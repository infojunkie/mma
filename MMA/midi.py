            This function tries its best to handle overlapping events.
            Easy to show effect with a table of note ON/OFF pairs. Both
            events are for the same note pitch.

            Offsets     |     200  |      300  |  320  |  420
            ---------|--------|--------|-------|--------
            Pair1     |     on      |       |  off  |
            Pair2     |      |      on   |       |  off

            The logic here will delete the OFF event at 320 and
            insert a new OFF at 300. Result is that when playing
            Pair1 will turn off at 300 followed by the same note
            in Pair2 beginning sounded right after. Why the on/off?
            Remember: Velocities may be different!

            However, if the unify flag is set we should end up with:

            Offsets     |     200  |      300  |  320  |  420
