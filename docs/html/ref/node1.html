<SPAN  CLASS="textit">plus much, much more</SPAN>!
It was written especially for me&mdash;I am an aspiring saxophonist and
wanted a program to &ldquo;play&rdquo; the piano and drums so I could practice
my jazz solos. With 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  I can create a track based on the chords in
a song, transpose it to the correct key for my instrument, and play my
very bad improvisations until they get a bit better.

<P>
I also lead a small combo group which is always missing at least one
player. With 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  generated tracks the group can practice and
perform even if a rhythm player is missing. This all works much better
than I expected when I started to write the program ... so much
better that I have used 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  generated tracks for live performances
with great success.

<P>
Around the world musicians are using 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  for practice, performance
and in their studios. Much more than ever imagined when this project
was started!

<P>

<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  is a large and complex program. It really does need a manual;

Installing 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT> </A>
</H1>

<P>

<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  is a Python program developed with version 2.7 of Python. At
the very least you will need this version (or later) of Python or any
of the Python 3.x versions.

<P>
To play the MIDI files you'll need a MIDI player. aplaymidi, tse3play,
and many others are available for Linux systems. For Windows and Mac
systems I'm sure there are many, many choices.

<P>
You'll need a text editor like <SPAN  CLASS="textit">vi</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">emacs</SPAN>, etc. to
create input files. Don't use a word processor!

<P>

<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  consists of a variety of bits and pieces:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The executable Python script, <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">mma</SPAN>,<A ID="tex2html7"
  HREF="#foot410"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN></SUP></A> must somewhere in your
  path. For users running Windows or Mac, please check 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  website
  for details on how to install on these systems. As distributed the
  file &ldquo;mma.py&rdquo; (and, when installed) &ldquo;mma&rdquo; are executable scripts
  with the correct permissions already set (this has no effect for
  Windows).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A number of Python modules (all are files ending in &ldquo;.py&rdquo;).
  These should all be installed under the directory
  <SPAN  CLASS="texttt"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">/usr/local/share/mma/MMA</SPAN></SPAN>. See the enclosed file
  <SPAN  CLASS="texttt"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">INSTALL</SPAN></SPAN> for some additional commentary.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A number of library files defining standard rhythms. These
  should all be installed under the directory
  <SPAN  CLASS="texttt"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">/usr/local/share/mma/lib/stdlib</SPAN></SPAN>. In addition, the library
  files depend on files in <SPAN  CLASS="texttt"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">/usr/local/share/mma/includes</SPAN></SPAN>.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The scripts <SPAN  CLASS="texttt"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">cp-install</SPAN></SPAN> or <SPAN  CLASS="texttt"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">ln-install</SPAN></SPAN> will install 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT> 
properly on most Linux systems. Both scripts assume that main script
is to be installed in <SPAN  CLASS="texttt"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">/usr/local/bin</SPAN></SPAN> and the support files in
<SPAN  CLASS="texttt"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">/usr/local/share/mma</SPAN></SPAN>. If you want an alternate location, you
can edit the paths in the script. The only supported alternate to use
is <SPAN  CLASS="texttt"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">/usr/share/mma</SPAN></SPAN>.

<P>
The difference between the two scripts is that <SPAN  CLASS="texttt"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">ln-install</SPAN></SPAN>
creates symbolic links to the current location; <SPAN  CLASS="texttt"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">cp-install</SPAN></SPAN>
copies the files. Which to use it up to you, but if you have unpacked
the distribution in a stable location it is probably easier to use the
link version.

<P>
In addition, you <SPAN  CLASS="textit">can</SPAN> run 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  from the directory created by
the untar. This is not recommended, but will show some of 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT> 's
stuff. In this case you'll have to execute the program file
<SPAN  CLASS="texttt">mma.py</SPAN>.

<P>
To run either install script, you should be &ldquo;root&rdquo; (or at least, you
need write permissions in <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">/usr/local/</SPAN>). Use the &ldquo;su&rdquo; or
&ldquo;sudo&rdquo; command for this.

<P>

<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  on a platform other than Linux, please

Comments</A>
</H1>

<P>
Proper indentation, white space and comments are a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">good
  thing</SPAN>&mdash;and you really should use them. But, in most cases 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT> 
really doesn't care:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Any leading space or tab characters are ignored,

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Multiple tabs and other white space are treated as single
  characters,

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Any blank lines in the input file are ignored.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Each line is initially parsed for comments. A comment is anything
following a &ldquo;//&rdquo; (2 forward slashes).<A ID="tex2html10"
  HREF="#foot367"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">6</SPAN></SUP></A>
<P>
Multi-line or block comments are also supported by 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT> . A block
comment is started by a &ldquo;/*&rdquo; and terminated by a
&ldquo;*/&rdquo;.<A ID="tex2html11"
  HREF="#foot369"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN></SUP></A> Nesting of block comments is not supported and will
generate unexpected results.

<P>
Both simple and block comments are stripped from the input stream.

<P>
Lines starting with the C<SMALL>OMMENT</SMALL> directive are also ignored (but
not stripped). See the <A HREF="node30.html#comment">comment
  discussion</A> for
details.

<P>

<H1><A ID="SECTION00160000000000000000">
Theory Of Operation</A>
</H1>

<P>
To understand how 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  works it's easiest to look at the initial
development concept. Initially, a program was wanted which would take
a file which looked something like:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Tempo 120 
<BR>
Fm 
<BR>
C7 
<BR>  ...</B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
and end up with a MIDI file which played the specified chords over a
drum track.

<P>
Of course, after starting this &ldquo;simple&rdquo; project a lot of
complexities developed.

<P>
First, the chord/bar specifications. Just having a single chord per
bar doesn't work&mdash;many songs have more than one chord per bar.
Second, what is the rhythm of the chords? What about bass line? Oh,
and where is the drummer?

<P>
Well, things got more complex after that. At a bare minimum, the
program or interface should have the ability to:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Specify multiple chords per bar,

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Define different patterns for chords, bass lines and drum
  tracks,

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Have easy to create and debug input files,

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Provide a reusable library that a user could simply plug in or
  modify.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
From these simple needs 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  was created.

<P>
The basic building blocks of 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  are P<SMALL>ATTERN</SMALL>s. A pattern is
a specification which tells 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  what notes of a chord to play, the
start point in a bar for the chord/notes, and the duration and the
volume of the notes.

<P>

<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  patterns are combined into S<SMALL>EQUENCE</SMALL>s. This lets you
create multi-bar rhythms.

<P>
A collection of patterns can be saved and recalled as G<SMALL>ROOVE</SMALL>s.
This makes it easy to pre-define complex rhythms in library files and
incorporate them into your song with a simple two word command.

<P>

<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  is bar or measure based (we use the words interchangeably in
this document). This means that 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  processes your song one bar at
a time. The music specification lines all assume that you are
specifying a single bar of music. Just like in &ldquo;real&rdquo; music the
number of beats per bar can be changed at any point, percussion notes
can occur at any point and chords can be changed at any point.

<P>
To make the input files look more musical, 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  supports
R<SMALL>EPEAT</SMALL>s and R<SMALL>EPEAT</SMALL>E<SMALL>NDING</SMALL>s. However, complexities like
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">D.S.</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Coda</SPAN> are not internally supported (but can be
created by using the G<SMALL>OTO</SMALL> command).

<P>

<H1><A ID="SECTION00170000000000000000">
Case Sensitivity</A>
</H1>

<P>
Just about everything in a 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  file is case insensitive.

<P>
This means that the command:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Tempo 120  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
could be entered in your file as:

<P>

Names for patterns, and grooves are also case insensitive.

The only exceptions are the names for chords, notes in S<SMALL>OLO</SMALL>s,
and filenames. In keeping with standard chord notation, chord names
are in mixed case; this is detailed in <A HREF="node8.html#sec-music">Musical

<DD>The problem, all humor aside, is
  that the viewpoints of a program's author and user are quite
  different. The two &ldquo;see&rdquo; problems and solutions differently, and
