<SPAN  CLASS="textit">plus much, much more</SPAN>!
It was written especially for me&mdash;I am an aspiring saxophonist and
wanted a program to &ldquo;play&rdquo; the piano and drums so I could practice
my jazz solos. With 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  I can create a track based on the chords in
a song, transpose it to the correct key for my instrument, and play my
very bad improvisations until they get a bit better.

<P>
I also lead a small combo group which is always missing at least one
player. With 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  generated tracks the group can practice and
perform even if a rhythm player is missing. This all works much better
than I expected when I started to write the program ... so much
better that I have used 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  generated tracks for live performances
with great success.

<P>
Around the world musicians are using 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  for practice, performance
and in their studios. Much more than ever imagined when this project
was started!

Installing 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT> </A>
</H1>

<P>

<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  is a Python program developed with version 2.7 of Python. At
the very least you will need this version (or later) of Python or any
of the Python 3.x versions.

<P>
To play the MIDI files you'll need a MIDI player. Aplaymidi, tse3play,
and many others are available for Linux systems. For Windows and Mac
systems I'm sure there are many, many choices.

<P>
You'll need a text editor like <SPAN  CLASS="textit">vi</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">emacs</SPAN>, etc. to
create input files. Don't use a word processor!

<P>

<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  consists of a variety of bits and pieces:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The executable Python script, <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">mma</SPAN>,<A ID="tex2html7"
  HREF="#foot428"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN></SUP></A> must somewhere in your
  path. For users running Windows or Mac, please check 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  website
  for details on how to install on these systems. As distributed the
  file &ldquo;mma.py&rdquo; (and, when installed) &ldquo;mma&rdquo; are executable scripts
  with the correct permissions already set (this has no effect for
  Windows).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A number of Python modules (all are files ending in &ldquo;.py&rdquo;).
  These should all be installed under the directory
  <SPAN  CLASS="texttt"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">/usr/local/share/mma/MMA</SPAN></SPAN>. See the enclosed file
  <SPAN  CLASS="texttt"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">INSTALL</SPAN></SPAN> for some additional commentary.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A number of library files defining standard rhythms. These
  should all be installed under the directory
  <SPAN  CLASS="texttt"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">/usr/local/share/mma/lib/stdlib</SPAN></SPAN>. In addition, the library
  files depend on files in <SPAN  CLASS="texttt"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">/usr/local/share/mma/includes</SPAN></SPAN>.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The scripts <SPAN  CLASS="texttt"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">cp-install</SPAN></SPAN> or <SPAN  CLASS="texttt"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">ln-install</SPAN></SPAN> will install 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT> 
properly on most Linux systems. Both scripts assume that main script
is to be installed in <SPAN  CLASS="texttt"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">/usr/local/bin</SPAN></SPAN> and the support files in
<SPAN  CLASS="texttt"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">/usr/local/share/mma</SPAN></SPAN>. If you want an alternate location, you
can edit the paths in the script. The only supported alternate to use
is <SPAN  CLASS="texttt"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">/usr/share/mma</SPAN></SPAN>.

<P>
The difference between the two scripts is that <SPAN  CLASS="texttt"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">ln-install</SPAN></SPAN>
creates symbolic links to the current location; <SPAN  CLASS="texttt"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">cp-install</SPAN></SPAN>
copies the files. Which to use it up to you, but if you have unpacked
the distribution in a stable location it is probably easier to use the
link version.

<P>
In addition, you <SPAN  CLASS="textit">can</SPAN> run 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  from the directory created by
the untar. This is not recommended, but will show some of 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT> 's
stuff. In this case you'll have to execute the program file
<SPAN  CLASS="texttt">mma.py</SPAN>.

<P>
To run either install script, you should be &ldquo;root&rdquo; (or at least, you
need write permissions in <SPAN  CLASS="texttt">/usr/local/</SPAN>). Use the &ldquo;su&rdquo; or
&ldquo;sudo&rdquo; command for this.

<P>

<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  on a platform other than Linux, please

Comments</A>
</H1>

<P>
Proper indentation, white space and comments are a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">good
  thing</SPAN>&mdash;and you really should use them. But, in most cases 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT> 
really doesn't care:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Any leading space or tab characters are ignored,

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Multiple tabs and other white space are treated as single
  characters,

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Any blank lines in the input file are ignored.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Each line is initially parsed for comments. A comment is anything
following a &ldquo;//&rdquo; (2 forward slashes).<A ID="tex2html10"
  HREF="#foot369"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">6</SPAN></SUP></A>
<P>
Multi-line or block comments are also supported by 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT> . A block
comment is started by a &ldquo;/*&rdquo; and terminated by a
&ldquo;*/&rdquo;.<A ID="tex2html11"
  HREF="#foot371"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN></SUP></A> Nesting of block comments is not supported and will
generate unexpected results.

<P>
Both simple and block comments are stripped from the input stream.

<P>
Lines starting with the C<SMALL>OMMENT</SMALL> directive are also ignored (but
not stripped). See the <A HREF="node30.html#comment">comment
  discussion</A> for
details.

<P>

<H1><A ID="SECTION00160000000000000000">
Theory Of Operation</A>
</H1>

<P>
To understand how 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  works it's easiest to look at the initial
development concept. Initially, a program was wanted which would take
a file which looked something like:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Tempo 120 
<BR>
Fm 
<BR>
C7 
<BR>  ...</B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
and end up with a MIDI file which played the specified chords over a
drum track.

<P>
Of course, after starting this &ldquo;simple&rdquo; project a lot of
complexities developed.

<P>
First, the chord/bar specifications. Just having a single chord per
bar doesn't work&mdash;many songs have more than one chord per bar.
Second, what is the rhythm of the chords? What about bass line? Oh,
and where is the drummer?

<P>
Well, things got more complex after that. At a bare minimum, the
program or interface should have the ability to:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Specify multiple chords per bar,

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Define different patterns for chords, bass lines and drum
  tracks,

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Have easy to create and debug input files,

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Provide a reusable library that a user could simply plug in or
  modify.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
From these simple needs 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  was created.

<P>
The basic building blocks of 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  are P<SMALL>ATTERN</SMALL>s. A pattern is
a specification which tells 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  what notes of a chord to play, the
start point in a bar for the chord/notes, and the duration and the
volume of the notes.

<P>

<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  patterns are combined into S<SMALL>EQUENCE</SMALL>s. This lets you
create multi-bar rhythms.

<P>
A collection of patterns can be saved and recalled as G<SMALL>ROOVE</SMALL>s.
This makes it easy to pre-define complex rhythms in library files and
incorporate them into your song with a simple two word command.

<P>

<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  is bar based.<A ID="tex2html12"
  HREF="#foot431"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN></SUP></A> This
means that 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  processes your song one bar at a time. The music
specification lines all assume that you are specifying a single bar of
music. Just like in &ldquo;real&rdquo; music the number of beats per bar can be
changed at any point, percussion notes can occur at any point and
chords can be changed at any point.

<P>
To make the input files look more musical, 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  supports
R<SMALL>EPEAT</SMALL>s and R<SMALL>EPEAT</SMALL>E<SMALL>NDING</SMALL>s. However, complexities like
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">D.S.</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Coda</SPAN> are not internally supported (but can be
created by using the G<SMALL>OTO</SMALL> command).

</H1>

<P>
The files generated are standard MIDI. A few points of interest:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>By default the generated files are &ldquo;type 2&rdquo;. You can change
  this to &ldquo;type 1&rdquo; using the SMF option (see
  <A HREF="node24.html#midismf">here</A>).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Each of 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT> 's tracks are generated as a separate MIDI track.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A comment advertising the creator of the file is inserted into
  to the META data. Details <A HREF="node28.html#xtra-nocredit">here</A>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The length of the generated file in seconds in saved in a META
  text field labeled &ldquo;DURATION:&rdquo;. A custom MIDI file player could
  use this to easily view the length of the file. This data is placed in
  the beginning of the MIDI file, before the individual music tracks.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<H1><A ID="SECTION00180000000000000000">
Case Sensitivity</A>
</H1>

<P>
Just about everything in a 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  file is case insensitive.

<P>
This means that the command:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Tempo 120  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
could be entered in your file as:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>TEMPO 120  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
or even

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>TeMpO 120  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
for the exact same results.

<P>
Names for patterns, and grooves are also case insensitive.

<P>
The only exceptions are the names for chords, notes in S<SMALL>OLO</SMALL>s,
and filenames. In keeping with standard chord notation, chord names
are in mixed case; this is detailed in <A HREF="node8.html#sec-music">Musical
  Data</A>. Filenames are covered in
<A HREF="node33.html#sec-paths">Paths and Filenames</A>.

<P>

<H1><A ID="SECTION00190000000000000000">
Script Conventions</A>
</H1>

<P>
A number of the commands available to 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  have builtin options. This
section attempts to summarize conventions which may or may not be
noted in the relevant sections of the manual. In most cases, this list
highlights seldom used items:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>True and False</STRONG></DT>
<DD>When a function relies on a &ldquo;TRUE&rdquo; or
    &ldquo;FALSE&rdquo; setting, you can also use &ldquo;ON&rdquo;, &ldquo;OFF&rdquo; or &ldquo;1&rdquo;,
    &ldquo;0&rdquo; for the identical result. There are a few exceptions and
    they are noted in the option's description.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Option Pairs</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Many option settings rely on a function which
    parses off options in the format &ldquo;Option=Value&rdquo;. Unless otherwise
    noted, the options can be placed anywhere in the command line. In
    a few cases the options must be placed at the start of the line
    so that more option pairs can be passed to a future command.

<P>
In all cases, the text &ldquo;&ndash;&rdquo; (two minus signs) will terminate the
    scan for more options.

<DD>The problem, all humor aside, is
