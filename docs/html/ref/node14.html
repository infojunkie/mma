Chord Voicing
</H1>

<P>
In music, a chord is simply defined as two more notes played
simultaneously<A ID="tex2html65"
  HREF="#foot2419"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">14</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN></SUP></A>. Now,
this doesn't mean that you can play just any two or three notes and
get a chord which sounds nice&mdash;but whatever you do get will be a
chord of some type. And, to further confuse the unwary, different
arrangements of the same notes sound better (or worse) in different
musical situations.

<P>
As a simple example, consider a C major chord. Built on the first,
third and fifth notes of a C major scale it can be manipulated into a
variety of sounds:

<P>
<DIV class="CENTER">
  <IMG WIDTH="80%"  SRC="mupex/cmajor.png" ALT="Lost Image">

</DIV>

<P>
These are all C major chords ... but they all have a different
sound or color. The different forms a chord can take are called
&ldquo;voicings&rdquo;. Again, this manual is not intended to be a primer on
musical theory&mdash;that's a subject for which lots of lessons with your
favorite music teacher is recommended. You'll need a bit of basic
music theory if you want to understand how and why 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  creates its
tracks.

<P>
The different options in this chapter effect not only the way chords
are constructed, but also the way bass lines and other tracks are
formed.

<P>
There are generally two ways in 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  to take care of voicings.

<P>

<OL>
<LI>use 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT> 's extensive V<SMALL>OICING</SMALL> options, most likely with
  the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">&rdquo;Optimal&rdquo;</SPAN> voicing algorithm,

<P>
</LI>
<LI>do everything by yourself with the commands I<SMALL>NVERT</SMALL> and
  C<SMALL>OMPRESS</SMALL>.

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
The commands L<SMALL>IMIT</SMALL> and D<SMALL>UP</SMALL>R<SMALL>OOT</SMALL> may be used independently
for both variants.

<P>

<H1><A ID="SECTION001410000000000000000">
Voicing</A>
</H1>

<P>
The V<SMALL>OICING</SMALL> command is used to set the voicing mode and several
other options relating to the selected mode. The command needs to have
a C<SMALL>HORD</SMALL> track specified and a series of Option=Value pairs. For
example:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Chord-Piano Voicing Mode=Optimal Rmove=10 Range=9  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
In the following sections all the options available will be covered.

<P>

<H2><A ID="SECTION001411000000000000000">
Voicing Mode</A>
</H2>

<P>
The easiest way to deal with chord voicings is via the V<SMALL>OICING
  </SMALL>M<SMALL>ODE=</SMALL>XX option.

<P>
When choosing the inversion of a chord to play an accompanist will
take into consideration the style of the piece and the chord
sequences. In a general sense, this is referred to as &ldquo;voicing&rdquo;.

<P>
A large number of the library files have been written to take
advantage of the following voicing commands. However, not all styles
of music take well to the concept. And, don't forget about the other
commands since they are useful in manipulating bass lines, as well as
other chord tracks (e.g., sustained strings).

<P>

<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  has a variety of sophisticated, intelligent
algorithms<A ID="tex2html66"
  HREF="#foot9482"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">14</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN></SUP></A> to deal with voicing.

<P>
As a general rule you should not use the I<SMALL>NVERT</SMALL> and
C<SMALL>OMPRESS</SMALL> commands in conjunction with the V<SMALL>OICING</SMALL>
command. If you do, you may create beautiful sounds. But, the results
are more likely to be less-than-pleasing. Use of voicing and other
combinations will display various warning messages.

<P>
The main command to enable voicings is:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Chord Voicing Mode=Type   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
As mentioned above, this command can only be applied to C<SMALL>HORD</SMALL>
tracks. Also note that this effects all bars in the sequence ...
you cannot have different voicings for different bars in the sequence
(attempting to do this would make no sense, but you could do it by
creating duplicate tracks with alternate bars sounding).

<P>
The following MODE types are available:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Optimal</STRONG></DT>
<DD>A basic algorithm which automatically chooses the best
  sounding voicing depending on the voicing played before. Always try
  this option before anything else. It might work just fine without
  further work.

<P>
The idea behind this algorithm is to keep voicings in a sequence
  close together. A pianist leaves his or her fingers where they are,
  if they still fit the next chord. Then, the notes closest to the
  fingers are selected for the next chord. This way characteristic
  notes are emphasized.

<P>
The following optional setting apply to chords generated with
  M<SMALL>ODE=</SMALL>O<SMALL>PTIMAL</SMALL>:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Voicing Range</STRONG></DT>
<DD>To get wider or closer voicings, you may define
    a range for the voicings. This can be adjusted with the
    R<SMALL>ANGE</SMALL> option:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Chord-Guitar Voicing Mode=Optimal Range=12  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
In most cases the default value of 12 should work just fine. But,
    you may want to fine tune ... it's all up to you.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Voicing Center</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Just minimizing the Euclidean distance between
    chords doesn't do the trick as there could be runaway progressions
    that let the voicings drift up or down infinitely.

<P>
When a chord is &ldquo;voiced&rdquo; or moved to a new position, a &ldquo;center
    point&rdquo; must be used as a base. By default, the fourth degree of
    the scale corresponding to the chord is a reasonable choice.
    However, you can change this with:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Chord-1 Voicing Center=&lt;value&gt;  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
The <SPAN  CLASS="textit">value</SPAN> in this command can be any number in the range 0
    to 12. Try different values. The color of your whole song might
    change.

<P>
Note that the value is the note in the scale, not a chord-note
    position.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Voicing Move</STRONG></DT>
<DD>To intensify a chord progression you may want to
    have ascending or descending movement of voicings. This option, in
    conjunction with the D<SMALL>IR</SMALL> optional (see below) sets the
    number of bars over which a movement is done.

<P>
For the M<SMALL>OVE</SMALL> option to have any effect you must also set
    the direction to either -1 or 1. Be careful that you don't force
    the chord too high or low on the scale. Use of this command in a
    R<SMALL>EPEAT</SMALL> section can cause unexpected results. For this
    reason you should include a S<SMALL>EQ</SMALL> command at the beginning of
    repeated sections of your songs.

<P>
In most cases the use of this command is limited to a section of a
    song, its use is not recommended in groove files. You might want
    to do something like this in a song:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>...select groove with voicing
<BR>
chords ...
<BR>
Chord-Piano Voicing Move=5 Dir=1 
<BR>
more chords...
<BR>
Chord-Piano Voicing Move=5 Dir=-1 
<BR>
more chords...</B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Voicing Dir</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This option is used in conjunction with the
    M<SMALL>OVE</SMALL> option to set the direction (-1 or 1) of the movement.

<P>
<A ID="voice-rmove"></A>  
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Voicing Rmove</STRONG></DT>
<DD>As an alternate to movement in a specified
    direction, random movement can add some color and variety to your
    songs. The command option is quite useful (and safe to use) in
    groove files. The argument for this option is a percentage value
    specifying the frequency to apply a move in a random direction.

<P>
For example:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Chord-3 Voicing Mode=Optimal Rmove=20  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
would cause a movement (randomly up or down) in 20% of the bars.
    As noted earlier, using explicit movement instructions can move
    the chord into an undesirable range or even &ldquo;off the keyboard&rdquo;;
    however, the algorithm used in RMOVE has a sanity check to ensure
    that the chord center position remains, approximately, in a two
    octave range.

<P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Key</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This mode attempts to cluster the notes of a chord around
  the root note of the key signature (<A HREF="node30.html#keysignature">see here</A>). For example, a C major chord has the
  notes &ldquo;C&rdquo;, &ldquo;E&rdquo; and &ldquo;G&rdquo;. If K<SMALL>EY</SMALL>S<SMALL>IG</SMALL> is set to &ldquo;C&rdquo; the
  &ldquo;G&rdquo; will be lowered by an octave. However, if the the key
  signature were to be set to &ldquo;E&rdquo; no changes would be made. The
  algorithm used is very simplistic, but the results sound
  satisfactory.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>KEY2</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is the same as the K<SMALL>EY</SMALL> option, but notes such
  as the 9th, 11th and 13th are not effected. This <SPAN  CLASS="textit">may</SPAN> give a
  brighter sound when using these chord types.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>DROP2, DROP2KEY</STRONG></DT>
<DD>In this mode the chord is played in root position with
  the second note from the top of the chord is lowered by one octave.
  The alternate D<SMALL>ROP2</SMALL>K<SMALL>EY</SMALL> will further cluster the notes around
  the root note of the key signature.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>DROP3, DROP3KEY</STRONG></DT>
<DD>In this mode the chord is played in root position with
  the third note of the chord from the top is lowered by one octave.
  The alternate D<SMALL>ROP3</SMALL>K<SMALL>EY</SMALL> clusters notes around the key signature.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>DROP23, DROP23KEY</STRONG></DT>
<DD>In this mode the chord is played in root position with
  the second and third notes of the chord, from the top, lowered by one octave.
  The alternate D<SMALL>ROP23</SMALL>K<SMALL>EY</SMALL> clusters notes around the key signature.

<P>
</DD>
</DL>

		<Table CellSpacing=0 Width="80%" Align="Center" CellPadding=10 BGColor="#dddddd" Border=3>
           <tr> <td>
	       The various &ldquo;drop&rdquo; voicings are standard for jazz piano and
    guitar players. Normally a player will not apply this option to a
    chord which has less than 4 notes. Simple triads (three note chords)
    like major or minor would have the third or root lowered by one
    full octave with a Drop2/3  ... and this may not be
    what you are expecting. In addition, note that the Drop2/3 will be
    applied after any chord inversions (and this is expected by
    &ldquo;real&rdquo; players).
	
           </td></tr>
        </Table>

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>ROOTKEY</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Compress the notes in the chord into a single octave
  and force all notes to be above the root of the key signature.
  Assuming a key of &ldquo;C&rdquo; a F major chord would be transformed from
  'f', 'a', 'c' <SPAN  CLASS="textit">to</SPAN> 'c', 'f', 'a'. However, if the key is set to
  &ldquo;F&rdquo; the chord would be unaffected.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Root</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This Option may for example be used to turn off
  V<SMALL>OICING</SMALL> within a song. V<SMALL>OICING </SMALL>M<SMALL>ODE=</SMALL>R<SMALL>OOT</SMALL> means nothing
  else than doing nothing, leaving all chords in root position.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>None</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is the same as the R<SMALL>OOT</SMALL> option.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Invert</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Rather than basing the inversion selection on an
  analysis of past chords, this method quite stupidly tries to keep
  chords around the base point of &ldquo;C&rdquo; by inverting &ldquo;G&rdquo; and &ldquo;A&rdquo;
  chords upward and &ldquo;D&rdquo;, &ldquo;E&rdquo; and &ldquo;F&rdquo; downward. The chords are
  also compressed. Certainly not an ideal algorithm, but it can be
  used to add variety in a piece. The chord setting I<SMALL>NVERT</SMALL>
  (<A HREF="#chord-invert">here</A>) is a different
  setting ... don't confuse the two and don't try to use them at
  the same time.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Compressed</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Does the same as the stand-alone C<SMALL>OMPRESS</SMALL>
  command. Like R<SMALL>OOT</SMALL>, it is only added to be used in some parts
  of a song where V<SMALL>OICING </SMALL>M<SMALL>ODE=</SMALL>O<SMALL>PTIMAL</SMALL> is used.

pitches.

<P>
To set multiple values you can use a comma separated list like:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>ChordAdjust E,E#,F,F#=-1  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
which will lower the listed chords by an octave.

<P>
To a large extent the need for octave adjustments depends on the chord
range of a song. For example, the supplied song &ldquo;A Day In The Life Of
A Fool&rdquo; needs all &ldquo;E&rdquo; and &ldquo;F&rdquo; chords to be adjusted down an
octave.

<P>
The value &ldquo;0&rdquo; will reset the adjustment to the original value.

<P>
You can reset all the values to their original values using the
R<SMALL>ESET</SMALL> option:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>ChordAdjust Reset  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
To view the current values in the chord adjustment table you can use
the $_C<SMALL>HORD</SMALL>A<SMALL>DJUST</SMALL> builtin variable.

<P>
When 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  grabs the notes for a chord, the notes are spread out from
the root position. This means that if you specify a &ldquo;C13&rdquo; you will
have an &ldquo;A&rdquo; nearly 2 octaves above the root note as part of the
chord. Depending on your instrumentation, pattern, and the chord
structure of your piece, notes outside of the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; single octave
range for a chord <SPAN  CLASS="textit">may</SPAN> sound strange.

<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  to put all chord notes in a single octave range.

<P>
This command is only effective in C<SMALL>HORD</SMALL> and A<SMALL>RPEGGIO</SMALL>
tracks. A warning message is printed if it is used in other contexts.

<P>
Instead of the values 0 and 1 you can use &ldquo;On&rdquo;, &ldquo;True&rdquo;, &ldquo;Off&rdquo;
and &ldquo;False&rdquo; to make your code a bit more readable.

<P>
You can specify a different C<SMALL>OMPRESS</SMALL> for each bar in a

DupRoot
</H1>

<P>
To add a bit of fullness to chords, it is quite common for keyboard
players to duplicate the root tone of a chord into a lower (or higher)
octave. This is accomplished in 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  with the command:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Chord DupRoot -1 -2 1 2   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
In the above example, the value of -1 adds a note one octave lower
than the root note, -2 adds the tone 2 octaves lower, etc. Similarly,
the value of 1 will add a note one octave higher than the root tone,
etc.

<P>
Only the values -9 to 9 are permitted.

<P>
You can have multiple notes generated by setting multiple duplicates
as comma separated lists:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Chord DupRoot -1,-2  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
will add notes 1 and 2 octaves below the root of the chord and

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Chord DupRoot -1,1,2  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
will add notes 1 below, and 1 and 2 above.<A ID="tex2html67"
  HREF="#foot2559"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">14</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN></SUP></A> <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Note:</SPAN> no spaces are
in the comma separated list (spaces indicate the next bar in the
sequence).

<P>
The volume used for the generated note(s) is the average of the
non-zero notes in the chord adjusted by the H<SMALL>ARMONY</SMALL>V<SMALL>OLUME</SMALL>
setting for the current track.<A ID="tex2html68"
  HREF="#foot9485"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">14</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN></SUP></A>
<P>
Different values can be used in each bar of the sequence.

<P>
The option is reset to 0 after all S<SMALL>EQUENCE</SMALL> or S<SMALL>EQ</SMALL>C<SMALL>LEAR</SMALL>
commands. To turn off this setting just use a value of 0:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Chord DupRoot 0  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
The D<SMALL>UP</SMALL>R<SMALL>OOT</SMALL> command is only valid in C<SMALL>HORD</SMALL> tracks.

<P>
D<SMALL>UP</SMALL>R<SMALL>OOT</SMALL> can only duplicate only the root tone of a chord. If
you want to duplicate other pitches in the chord, create a B<SMALL>ASS</SMALL>
track with the appropriate pattern. For example, if you want to
duplicate the fifths in your chord, try this:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Begin Chord 
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;Voice Piano1

<BR>
End   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
The above, very simple, example will play the third and fifth notes of
the chord an octave lower using the same pattern as the basic chords.

<P>

<H1><A ID="SECTION001450000000000000000"></A> <A ID="chord-invert"></A>
<BR>
Invert
</H1> 

<P>
By default 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  uses chords in the root position. By example, the
notes of a C major chord are C, E and G. Chords can be inverted
(something musicians do all the time). Sticking with the C major
chord, the first inversion shifts the root note up an octave and the
chord becomes E, G and C. The second inversion is G, C and E.

<P>

<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  extends the concept of inversion a bit by permitting the shift
to be to the left or right, and the number of shifts is not limited.
So, you could shift a chord up several octaves by using large invert
values.<A ID="tex2html69"
  HREF="#foot9487"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">14</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN></SUP></A>
<P>
Inversions can be different in each bar of a sequence. For example
example:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>SeqSize 4 
<BR>
Chord-1 Sequence STR1 
<BR>
Chord-1 Invert 0 1 0 1   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
Here the sequence pattern size is set to 4 bars and the pattern for
each bar in the Chord-1 track is set to &ldquo;STR1&rdquo;. Without the next
line, this would result in a rather boring, repeating pattern. But,
the Invert command forces the chord to be in the root position for the
first bar, the first inversion for the second, etc.

<P>
You can use a negative Invert value:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Chord-1 Invert -1  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
In this case the C major chord becomes G, C and E.

<P>
Note that using fewer Invert arguments than the current sequence size
is permitted. 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  simply expands the number of arguments to the
current sequence size. You may use a &ldquo;/&rdquo; for a repeated value.

<P>
A S<SMALL>EQUENCE</SMALL> or C<SMALL>LEAR</SMALL>S<SMALL>EQ</SMALL> command resets I<SMALL>NVERT</SMALL> to
0.

<P>
This command on has an effect in C<SMALL>HORD</SMALL> and A<SMALL>RPEGGIO</SMALL>
tracks. And, frankly, A<SMALL>RPEGGIO</SMALL>s sound a bit odd with
inversions.

<P>
If you use a large value for I<SMALL>NVERT</SMALL> you can force the notes out
of the normal MIDI range. In this case the lowest or highest possible
MIDI note value will be used.

<P>
A further option is to randomize the inversion process. If you specify
a range of values (two values joined with a comma) 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  will select
a random value from that range and apply that to the invert. For
example:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Chord Invert -2,2   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
will cause a random invert of -2, -1, 0, 1 or 2 each time a chord is
generated. The results can be quite jarring and unexpected.

<P>
The values used to set this option must be in the range -10 to 10.

<P>

<H1><A ID="SECTION001460000000000000000"></A> <A ID="limit"></A>
<BR>
Limit
</H1> 

<P>
If you use so-called &ldquo;jazz&rdquo; chords in your piece, some people might
not like the results. To some folks, chords like 11th, 13th, and
variations have a dissonant sound. And, sometimes they are in a chart,
but don't really make sense. The L<SMALL>IMIT</SMALL> command can be used to
set the number of notes of a chord used.

<P>
For example:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Chord Limit 4  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
will limit any chords used in the C<SMALL>HORD</SMALL> track to the first 4
notes of a chord. So, if you have a C11 chord which is C, E, G,
B<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.81ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$\flat$"></SPAN>, D, and F, the chord will be truncated to C, E, G and
B<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.81ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$\flat$"></SPAN>.

<P>
This command only applies to C<SMALL>HORD</SMALL> and A<SMALL>RPEGGIO</SMALL> tracks.
It can be set for other tracks, but the setting will have no effect
(no warning will be displayed).

<P>

<UL>
<LI>L<SMALL>IMIT</SMALL> takes any single value from 3 to 8 as an argument
  which sets the desired maximum number of notes in a chord. This command
  applies to all chords in the sequence.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>To restore to its default (off) setting, use a 0, &ldquo;Off&rdquo; or
  &ldquo;False&rdquo; as the argument. The D<SMALL>ROP</SMALL> setting (below) is not
  saved.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>
To further refine the pruning of chords you can also set a D<SMALL>ROP</SMALL>
value as an option, for example:

<P>
<A ID="accordion-voicing"></A>
      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Chord-Accordion Limit 3 Drop=5  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
In this case 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  will remove the fifth scale note from the chords
with a length greater than three and prune any remaining notes from
large chords (ie, a &ldquo;13&rdquo;) and force the total number of notes to
three.<A ID="tex2html70"
  HREF="#foot2609"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">14</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">6</SPAN></SUP></A>
<P>
The D<SMALL>ROP</SMALL> argument must be in the range of 1 to 7 and represents
a single note in the corresponding scale for that chord. For example,
to drop all root notes for a sequence:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Chord-NoRoot Limit 8 Drop=1  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
Assuming a C7 chord (C, E, G, B<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.81ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$\flat$"></SPAN>) the C would be removed (the
scale for the chord is C, D, E, F, G, A, B<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.81ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$\flat$"></SPAN>). Applying the
same to a C5 (a power chord) would eliminate the first C note (a C5
chord has the scale C, D, E, F, G, A, B and the note C, C, G, G
... in this case it ends up effectively doing nothing).

<P>
The F<SMALL>ORCE</SMALL> option is set with a &ldquo;True&rdquo; or &ldquo;False&rdquo; argument
(You can use &ldquo;On&rdquo;, &ldquo;1&rdquo;, etc. as well. &ldquo;False&rdquo; is the default and
is included only for completeness.)

<P>
Use of this will force the D<SMALL>ROP</SMALL> option to be executed no
matter how many notes are in the chord. Some simple examples:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>C<SMALL>HORD </SMALL>L<SMALL>IMIT 8 </SMALL>D<SMALL>ROP=1</SMALL></STRONG></DT>
<DD>No effect on any chords since they will all be less than length eight.

</DD>
<DT><STRONG>C<SMALL>HORD </SMALL>L<SMALL>IMIT 8 </SMALL>D<SMALL>ROP=1 </SMALL>F<SMALL>ORCE=</SMALL>T<SMALL>RUE</SMALL></STRONG></DT>
<DD>All chords will have the root note removed. This will result in three
note chords (major and minor triads) only having two notes.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>C<SMALL>HORD </SMALL>L<SMALL>IMIT 3 </SMALL>D<SMALL>ROP=1</SMALL></STRONG></DT>
<DD>Chords with more than three notes will have the root note removed. No
chords will be shorter than three notes, unless they were created that
way in a chord table.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>C<SMALL>HORD </SMALL>L<SMALL>IMIT 3 </SMALL>D<SMALL>ROP=1 </SMALL>F<SMALL>ORCE=</SMALL>T<SMALL>RUE</SMALL></STRONG></DT>
<DD>All chords will have the root note dropped. Three note chords will be
shortened to two.

Many instruments have a limited range. For example, the bass section
of an accordion is limited to a single octave.<A ID="tex2html71"
  HREF="#foot2631"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">14</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">7</SPAN></SUP></A> To emulate these sounds it is a simple matter of
limiting 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT> 's output to match the instrument. For example, in the
&ldquo;frenchwaltz&rdquo; file you will find the directive:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Chord NoteSpan 48 59  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
which forces all C<SMALL>HORD</SMALL> tones to the single octave represented
by the MIDI values 48 though 59.

<P>
This command is applied over other voicing commands like O<SMALL>CTAVE</SMALL>
and R<SMALL>ANGE</SMALL> and even T<SMALL>RANSPOSE</SMALL>. Notes will still be
calculated with respect to these settings, but then they'll be forced
into the limited N<SMALL>OTE</SMALL>S<SMALL>PAN</SMALL>.

<P>
N<SMALL>OTE</SMALL>S<SMALL>PAN</SMALL> expects two arguments: The first is the range start,
the second the range end (first and last notes to use). The values are
MIDI tones and must be in the range 0 to 127. The first value must be
less than the second, and the range must represent at least one full
octave (12 notes). It can be applied to all tracks except D<SMALL>RUM</SMALL>.

<P>
For A<SMALL>RPEGGIO</SMALL> and S<SMALL>CALE</SMALL> tracks you can specify the number
of octaves used. The effects of the R<SMALL>ANGE</SMALL> command is slightly
different between the two.

<P>
S<SMALL>CALE</SMALL>: Scale tracks, by default, create three octave scales.
The R<SMALL>ANGE</SMALL> value will modify this to the number of octaves
specified. For example:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Scale Range 1  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
will force the scales to one octave. A value of 4 would create 4
octave scales, etc.

<P>
You can use fractional values when specifying R<SMALL>ANGE</SMALL>. For
example:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Scale Range .3  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
will create a scale of 2 notes.<A ID="tex2html72"
  HREF="#foot2652"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">14</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">8</SPAN></SUP></A> And,

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Scale Range 1.5  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
will create a scale of 10 notes. Now, this gets a bit more confusing
for you if you have set S<SMALL>CALE</SMALL>T<SMALL>YPE</SMALL> C<SMALL>HROMATIC</SMALL>. In this
case a R<SMALL>ANGE 1</SMALL> would generate 12 notes, and R<SMALL>ANGE 1.5</SMALL>
18.

<P>
Partial scales are useful in generating special effects.

<P>
A<SMALL>RPEGGIO</SMALL>: Normally, arpeggios use a single octave.<A ID="tex2html73"
  HREF="#foot2659"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">14</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">9</SPAN></SUP></A> The R<SMALL>ANGE</SMALL> command specifies the
number of octaves<A ID="tex2html74"
  HREF="#foot9488"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">14</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">10</SPAN></SUP></A> to use. A fractional value can be used; the
exact result depends on the number of notes in the current chord.

<P>
In all cases the values of &ldquo;0&rdquo; and &rdquo;1&rdquo; have the same effect.

<P>
For both S<SMALL>CALE</SMALL> and A<SMALL>RPEGGIO</SMALL> there will always be a
minimum of two notes in the sequence. In all other tracks this option
is ignored.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">NoteList</SPAN> is a comma separated list of note offsets
  (actually MIDI note values), all of which are enclosed in a set of
  &ldquo;()&rdquo;s. There must be at least 2 note offsets and no more than 8
  and all values must be in the range 0 to 24. Using an existing chord
  type, a &ldquo;7&rdquo; chord would be defined with (0, 4, 7, 10). In the case
  of a C7 chord, this translates to the notes (c, e, g, b<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG

  0 to 24. Following on the C7 example above, the scale list would be

In this case a normal Major chord will be used in line 1. In line 2
the new &ldquo;15&rdquo; will be used. Note the trick in the scale: by setting
all the offsets to &ldquo;0&rdquo; only the root note is available to the
<SMALL>WALK</SMALL> and <SMALL>BASS</SMALL> tracks.

<P>
Sometimes you'll see a new chord type that 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  doesn't know. You
could write the author and ask him to add this new type, but if it is
something quite odd or rare, it might be easier to define it in your
song. Let's pretend that you've encountered a &ldquo;Cmaj12&rdquo; A reasonable
guess is that this is a major 7 with an added 12th (just the 5th up an
octave). You could change the &ldquo;maj12&rdquo; part of the chord to a &ldquo;M7&rdquo;
or &ldquo;maj7&rdquo; and it should sound fine. But:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>DefChord maj12 (0, 4, 7, 11, 19) (0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11)   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
is much more fun. Note a few details:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The name &ldquo;maj12&rdquo; can be used with any chord. You can have
  &ldquo;Cmaj12&rdquo; or G<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG

 ALT="$\flat$"></SPAN>maj12&rdquo;.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>&ldquo;maj12&rdquo; a case sensitive name. The name &ldquo;Maj12&rdquo; is quite
  different (and unknown).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A better name might be &ldquo;maj(add12)&rdquo;.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The note and scale offsets are MIDI values. They are easy to
  figure if you think of the chord as a &ldquo;C&rdquo;. Just count off notes
  from &ldquo;C&rdquo; on a keyboard (C is note 0).

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Do Not</SPAN> include a chord name (i.e., C or B<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.81ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$\flat$"></SPAN>) in the
  definition. Just the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">type</SPAN>.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The final example handles a minor problem in 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  and &ldquo;diminished&rdquo;
chords. In most of the music the author of 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  encounters, the
marking &ldquo;dim&rdquo; on a chord usually means a &ldquo;diminished 7th&rdquo;. So,
when 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  initializes it creates a copy of the &ldquo;dim7&rdquo; and calls it
&ldquo;dim&rdquo;. But, some people think that &ldquo;dim&rdquo; should reference a
&ldquo;diminished triad&rdquo;. It's pretty easy to change this by creating a
new definition for &ldquo;dim&rdquo;:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>DefChord dim (0, 3, 6) (0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9 )   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
In this example the scale notes use the same notes as those in a
&ldquo;dim7&rdquo;. You might want to change the B<!-- MATH
 $\flat{}\flat$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.81ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$\flat$"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.81ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$\flat$"></SPAN> (9) to B<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.81ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$\flat$"></SPAN>
(10) or B (11). If you really disagree with the choice to make a dim7
the default you could even put this in a <SPAN  CLASS="texttt"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">mmarc</SPAN></SPAN> file.

<P>
It is even easier to use the non-standard notation &ldquo;dim3&rdquo; to specify
a diminished triad. Better yet: use the author's preferred and
unambiguous &ldquo;m<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 STYLE="height: 1.81ex; vertical-align: -0.10ex; " SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$\flat$"></SPAN>5&rdquo; for a triad and &ldquo;dim7&rdquo; for a four note
chord.

This command can be used to make the creation of custom chords a bit
simpler. Simply pass one or more chord types after the command and
they will be displayed on your terminal. Example:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>PrintChord m M7 dim  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
in a file should display:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>m : (0, 3, 7) (0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11) Minor triad. 
<BR>
M7 : (0, 4, 7, 11) (0, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 11) Major 7th. 
<BR>
dim : (0, 3, 6, 9) (0, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9) Diminished. 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  assumes
  a diminished 7th.  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
From this you can cut and paste, change the chord or scale and insert
the data into a D<SMALL>EF</SMALL>C<SMALL>HORD</SMALL> command.

<P>

<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  makes other adjustments on-the-fly to your chords. This is done
to make the resulting sounds &ldquo;more musical&rdquo; ... to keep life
interesting, the definition of &ldquo;more musical&rdquo; is quite elusive. The
following notes will try to list some of the more common adjustments
made &ldquo;behind your back&rdquo;.

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Just before the notes (MIDI events) for a chord are generated
  the first and last notes in the chord are compared. If they are a
  separated by a half-step (or 1 MIDI value) or an octave plus
  half-step, the volume of the first note is halved. This happens in
  chords such as a Major-7th or Flat-9th. If the adjustment is not
  done the dissonance between the two tones may overwhelm the ear.
