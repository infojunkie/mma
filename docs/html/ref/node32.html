Paths, Files and Libraries
</H1>

<P>
This chapter covers 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  filenames, extensions and a variety of
commands and/or directives which effect the way in which files are
read and processed.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION003201000000000000000">

<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  Modules</A>
</H2>
First a few comments on the location of the 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  Python modules.

<P>
The Python language (which was used to write 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT> ) has a very useful
feature: it can include other files and refer to functions and data
defined in these files. A large number of these files or modules are
included in every Python distribution. The program 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  consists of
a short ``main'' program and several ``module'' files. Without these
additional modules 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  will not work.

<P>
The only sticky problem in a program intended for a wider audience is
where to place these modules. Hopefully, it is a ``good thing'' that
they should be in one of several locations. On a Linux (and Mac)
system the following locations are checked:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">/usr/local/share/mma/MMA</SPAN></TT>
</LI>
<LI><TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">/usr/share/mma/MMA</SPAN></TT>
</LI>
<LI><TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">./MMA</SPAN></TT>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
on Mac the same path as Linux is used, with the addition of:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">/Users/Shared/mma/MMA</SPAN></TT>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
and on a Windows system:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">c:\mma\MMA</SPAN></TT>
</LI>
<LI><TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">c:\Program Files\mma</SPAN></TT>
</LI>
<LI><TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">.\MMA</SPAN></TT>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
To make it possible to have multiple installations of 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  (most
likely for testing), a check is made to see the modules are present in
the home of the 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  executable. This is stored in the Python system
variable sys.path[0]. Note: this is not the same as <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">.</SPAN></TT>.

<P>
Additionally it is possible to place the modules in your python-site
directory. If, when initializing itself, 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  cannot find the needed
modules it will terminate with an error message.

<P>

<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  assumes that the default include and library directories are
located in the above listed directories as well. If these can't be
found a warning message will be displayed.

<P>
If you really need to, you can modify this in the main <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">mma.py</SPAN></TT>
script.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION003202000000000000000">
Special Characters In Filenames</A>
</H2>

<P>
In all the following sections we refer to various forms of
``filename'' and ``path''. 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  parses files and uses various forms
of ``whitespace''<A NAME="tex2html126"
  HREF="#foot18819"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">32</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN></SUP></A> to separate different parts of
commands. This means that you cannot, easily, include space characters
in a filename embedded in a 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  source file. But, you can, if
needed. When 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  uses a path or filename it first transforms any
sequences of the literal ``\x20'' into ``space''
characters.

<P>
If you are on a Windows or Mac platform you may need to use the space
feature, if not for filenames, for paths.

<P>
For example:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>SetMidiPlayer C:\Program\x20Files\Windows\x20Player  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
In this example we are setting our MIDI player to
``<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf"><code>C:\Program Files\Windows Player</code></SPAN></TT>''. The
``\x20''s are converted to space characters.

<P>
When running 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  on a Windows platform you don't need to use the
rather ugly ``\''s since Python will conveniently
convert paths with normal ``forward'' slash characters to something
Windows understands.

<P>
A common mistake made, especially by users on Windows platforms, is
using quote characters to delimit a filename. <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Don't use
  quotation marks!</SPAN> 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  doesn't see anything special in quotes and
the quote characters will be assumed to be part of a filename ...
and it won't work.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION003203000000000000000">
Tildes In Filenames</A>
</H2>

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>SetOutPath ~/music/midies  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
In this case the ``~'' is replaced with the path of the
current user (for details see the Python documentation for
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">os.path.expanduser()</SPAN>). The result of tilde expansions is system
dependent and varies between Linux, Mac, and Windows.

<P>
The case of a filename is relevant if your system supports
case-sensitive filenames. For example, on a Linux system the names
``file.mid'' and ``File.MID'' refer to different files; on a Windows
system they refer to the same file.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION003204000000000000000">
Filenames and the Command Line</A>
</H2>

<P>
Please note that the above discussion, especially the parts concerning
embedded spaces, apply only to file and path names in a 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  source
file. If you want to compile a <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">.mma</SPAN></TT> file with a space character
it is not a problem. From the command line:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>$ mma ''my file''  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
works just fine ... but note that we used quotation marks to tell
the shell, not 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  that ``my file'' is one name, not two.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION003210000000000000000"></A> <A NAME="file-extensions"></A>
<BR>
File Extensions
</H1>

<P>
For most files the use of a the file name extension ``.mma'' is
optional. However, it is suggested that most files (with the
exceptions listed below) have the extension present. It makes it much
easier to identify 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  song and library files and to do selective
processing on these files.

<P>
In processing an input song file 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  can encounter several
different types of input files. For all files, the initial search is
done by adding the file name extension ``.mma'' to file name (unless
it is already present), then a search for the file as given is done.

<P>
For files included with the U<SMALL>SE</SMALL> directive, the directory set
with <SMALL>SET</SMALL>L<SMALL>IB</SMALL>P<SMALL>ATH</SMALL> is first checked, followed by the current
directory.

<P>
For files included with the I<SMALL>NCLUDE</SMALL> directive, the directory
set with <SMALL>SET</SMALL>I<SMALL>NC</SMALL>P<SMALL>ATH</SMALL> is first checked, followed by the current
directory.

<P>
Following is a summary of the different files supported:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Song Files</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The input file specified on the command line should
  always be named with the ``.mma'' extension. When 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  searches
  for the file it will automatically add the extension if the file
  name specified does not exist and doesn't have the extension.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Library Files</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Library files <SPAN  CLASS="textit">really should</SPAN> all be named
  with the extension. 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  will find non-extension names when used
  in a U<SMALL>SE</SMALL> or I<SMALL>NCLUDE</SMALL> directive. However, it will not
  process these files when creating indexes with the ``-g'' command
  line option--these index files are used by the G<SMALL>ROOVE</SMALL>
  commands to automatically find and include libraries.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>RC Files</STRONG></DT>
<DD>As noted in the RC-File discussion
  <A HREF="#sec-rc">(here)</A> 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  will
  automatically include a variety of ``RC'' files. You can use the
  extension on these files, but common usage suggests that these files
  are probably better without.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>MMAstart and MMAend</STRONG></DT>
<DD>
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  will automatically include files at
  the beginning or end of processing (<A HREF="#sec-mmaend">start/end
    details</A>). Typically these files are
  named MMA<SMALL>START</SMALL> and MMA<SMALL>END</SMALL>. Common usage is to
  <SPAN  CLASS="textit">not</SPAN> use the extension if the file is in the current
  directory; use the file if it is in an ``includes'' directory.

<P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
One further point to remember is that filenames specified on the
command line are subject to wild-card expansion via the shell you are
using.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION003220000000000000000">
Eof</A>
</H1>

<P>
Normally, a file is processed until its end. However, you can
short-circuit this behavior with the E<SMALL>OF</SMALL> directive. If 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT> 
finds a line starting with E<SMALL>OF</SMALL> no further processing will be
done on that file ... it's just as if the real end of file was
encountered. Anything on the same line, after the E<SMALL>OF</SMALL> is also
discarded.

<P>
You may find this handy if you want to test process only a part of a
file, or if you making large edits to a library file. It is often used
to quit when using the L<SMALL>ABEL</SMALL> and G<SMALL>OTO</SMALL> directives to
simulate constructs like <SPAN  CLASS="textit">D.C. al Coda</SPAN>, etc.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION003230000000000000000"></A> <A NAME="libpath"></A>
<BR>
LibPath
</H1> 

<P>
The search for library files can be set with the LibPath variable. To
set L<SMALL>IB</SMALL>P<SMALL>ATH</SMALL>:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>SetLibPath PATH  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
You can have as many paths in the S<SMALL>ET</SMALL>L<SMALL>IB</SMALL>P<SMALL>ATH</SMALL> directive as you
want.

<P>
When 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  starts up it sets the library path to the first valid
directory in the list:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">/usr/local/share/mma/lib</SPAN></TT>

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">/usr/share/mma/lib</SPAN></TT>

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">./lib</SPAN></TT>

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The last choice lets you run 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  directly from the distribution
directory.

<P>
When 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  initializes it will force the directory <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">stdlib</SPAN></TT> to
be the first directory in the list. It will also display a warming
message if <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">stdlib</SPAN></TT> is not found. If the path is changed later by
the user, the user's order will be honored. No check for <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">stdlib</SPAN></TT>
being present is made.

<P>
You are free to change this to any other location(s) in a
<A HREF="#sec-rc">RCFile</A>. Remember that the
previous setting is lost. If you just want to add directories, use a
macro. Example:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>SetLibPath&nbsp;/mymma $_LibPath   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
will add the <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">mma</SPAN></TT> directory in your HOME directory.

<P>
L<SMALL>IB</SMALL>P<SMALL>ATH</SMALL> is used by the routine which auto-loads grooves from
the library, and the U<SMALL>SE</SMALL> directive. The -g and -G command line
options are used to maintain the library
<A HREF="node2.html#g-option">database</A>).

<P>
The current setting can be accessed via the macro $_L<SMALL>IB</SMALL>P<SMALL>ATH</SMALL>.

<P>
One useful trick is to set the L<SMALL>IB</SMALL>P<SMALL>ATH</SMALL> to limit G<SMALL>ROOVE</SMALL>
selection to a specific library. For example:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>set c $_LibPath + casio 
<BR>
setLibPath $c   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
Note that you need to do this in two steps since it's only the
<SMALL>SET</SMALL> command that recognizes string concatenation.

<P>
A better way to have your own personal grooves checked first might be:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>set c $_LibPath + mylib 
<BR>
setLibPath $c $_LibPath  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
which is set <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">mylib</SPAN></TT> to be the first directory checked for a
groove.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION003240000000000000000"></A> <A NAME="midiplayer"></A>
<BR>
MIDIPlayer
</H1> 

<P>
When using the -P command line option 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  uses the MIDI file player
defined with S<SMALL>ET</SMALL>MIDI<SMALL>PLAYER</SMALL> to play the generated file. By
default the program is set to ``aplaymidi'' on Linux, ``open'' on Mac,
and an empty file on Windows. You can change this to a different
player:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>SetMIDIplayer /usr/local/kmid  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
You will probably want to use this command in an RC file.

<P>
It is permissible to include command options as well. So, for example,
on Linux you might do:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>SetMIDIplayer timidity -a  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
Command line options with an ``='' are permitted, so long as they
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">do not</SPAN> start with an alpha character. So,

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>SetMIDIplayer aplaymidi -port=12:3  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
will work.

<P>
To set to an empty name, just use the command with no arguments:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>SetMIDIplayer  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
An empty filename On a Linux host will generate an error if you
attempt to preview a file with the -P command line option; on Windows
hosts the empty string instructs Windows to use the default player for
the generated MIDI file.

<P>
There are two additional settings for the MIDI file player:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>In a Windows environment the player will be forked as a
  background process and 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  will wait for a set time.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>In a Unix environment the player will be forked in the
  foreground and 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  will wait for the player to terminate.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
You can change the above behavior with the B<SMALL>ACKGROUND</SMALL> and
D<SMALL>ELAY</SMALL> options.

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>SetMidiPlayer BackGround=1 Delay=4 myplayer -abc   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
In the above example the player is forced to play as a background
process with a delay time of 4 seconds. The player name is set to
``myplayer'' with an option string of ``-abc''.

<P>
and,

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>SetMidiPlayer BackGround=0 Delay=4   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
will set the player name to ``'' (which is only valid in a Windows
environment) and force it to play in the foreground. In this case the
delay setting will have no effect.

<P>
The B<SMALL>ACK</SMALL>G<SMALL>ROUND</SMALL> option can be set with ``1'' or ``Yes'' and
unset with ``0'' or ``No''. No other values are valid.

<P>
Note that when setting player options the player name is required
(otherwise it is set to ``'').

<P>

Groove Previews
</H1>

<P>

<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  comes with well over 1000 different grooves in its standard
libraries. Determining which to use in your song can be quite a chore.
For this reason a special ``preview'' command line option has been
included. To use it, first decide on which G<SMALL>ROOVE</SMALL> you'd like to
listen to. Then, from a terminal or other command line interface, type
a command like:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>$ mma -V bolero  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
This will create a short (4 bar) file with a G<SMALL>ROOVE </SMALL>B<SMALL>OLERO</SMALL>
command and some chords. This file will then be played in the same
manner as the <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-P</SPAN> command line option. If you don't hear the
file being played or if you get an error message, please refer to the
S<SMALL>ET</SMALL>M<SMALL>IDI</SMALL>P<SMALL>LAYER</SMALL> section, above.

<P>
In addition to using a default set of chords, etc. you can customize
the preview with some command line options. Note that each of these
options can be placed anywhere on the line in any order. Nothing in
the options (except chord names) is case sensitive. Each of the
commands must have an <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">=</SPAN> and contain no spaces:

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>Count</DT>
<DD>set the number of bars to create/play. The default is 4.

<P>
</DD>
<DT>Chords</DT>
<DD>set the chords to use. The chords must be in the form of
  a list with commas separating the chord names. For example:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Chords=A,Gm,C,D7   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
By default we use:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Chords=I,vi,ii,V7   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
A generic introduction notated in Roman numerals.

<P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
Any other 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  command can be inserted in a <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">-V</SPAN> line. For
example, to play a 4 bar sequence in the key of <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">G</SPAN> with a
tempo of 144:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>$ mma -V mambo2 Chords=I,I,V7,III Tempo=144 KeySig=G   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
The supplied utility <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">mma-gb.py</SPAN></TT> makes extensive use of this
command set.

<P>
With the extended <SMALL>GROOVE</SMALL> name extension, (<A HREF="node6.html#extended-groove">more
  details</A>) you can preview grooves from
files not yet in the library (or database). Assuming you are working
on a new library file in your current directory, just issue a command
like:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>$ mma -V ./newfile:newgroove   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
You can skip the leading ``./'' in the path, but it forces a bit more
verbiage frm 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT> .

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION003260000000000000000"></A> <A NAME="setoutpath"></A>
<BR>
OutPath
</H1> 

<P>
MIDI file generation is to an automatically generated filename
(<A HREF="node2.html#sec-running">more details</A>). If the
O<SMALL>UT</SMALL>P<SMALL>ATH</SMALL> variable is set, that value will be prepended to the
output filename. To set the value:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>SetOutPath PATH  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
Just make sure that ``PATH'' is a simple path name. The variable is
case sensitive (assuming that your operating system supports case
sensitive filenames). This is a common directive in a RC file
(<A HREF="#sec-rc">more details</A>). By default, it
has no value.

<P>
You can disable the O<SMALL>UT</SMALL>P<SMALL>ATH</SMALL> variable quite simply: just issue
the command without an argument.

<P>
If the name set by this command begins with a ``.'', ``/'' or
`` \'' it is prepended to the complete filename specified on
the command line. For example, if you have the input filename
<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">test.mma</SPAN></TT> and the output path is
<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">˜/mids</SPAN></TT> --the output file will
be <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">/home/bob/mids/test.mid</SPAN></TT>.

<P>
If the name doesn't start with the special characters noted in the
preceding paragraph the contents of the path will be inserted before
the filename portion of the input filename. Again, an example: the
input filename is <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">mma/rock/crying</SPAN></TT> and the output path is
``midi''--the output file will be <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">mma/rock/midi/crying.mid</SPAN></TT>.

<P>
The current setting can be accessed via the macro $_OutPath.

<P>
Note that this option is ignored if you use the <A HREF="node2.html#f-option">-f
  command line option</A> or
if an absolute name for the input file (one starting with a ``/'' or a
``~'') is used.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION003270000000000000000"></A>

Include
</H1>

<P>
Other files with sequence, pattern or music data can be included at
any point in your input file. There is no limit to the level of
includes.

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Include Filename  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
A search for the file is done in the I<SMALL>NC</SMALL>P<SMALL>ATH</SMALL> directories (see
below) and the current directory. The ``.mma'' filename extension is
optional (if a filename exists both with and without the ``.mma''
extension, the file with the extension will be used).

<P>
The use of this command should be quite rare in user files; however,
it is used extensively in library files to include standard patterns.

<P>

<P>
The search for include files can be set with the I<SMALL>NC</SMALL>P<SMALL>ATH</SMALL>
variable. To set I<SMALL>NC</SMALL>P<SMALL>ATH</SMALL>:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>SetIncPath PATH  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
You can have as many paths in the S<SMALL>ET</SMALL>I<SMALL>NC</SMALL>P<SMALL>ATH</SMALL> directive as you
need.

<P>
When 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  initializes it sets the include path to first found
directory in:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">/usr/local/share/mma/includes</SPAN></TT>
</LI>
<LI><TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">/usr/share/mma/includes</SPAN></TT>
</LI>
<LI><TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">./includes</SPAN></TT>

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The last location lets you run 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  from the distribution directory.

<P>
If this value is not appropriate for your system, you are free to
change it in a RC File. If you need to add a second directory to this
list, remember that previous settings are lost. So, to add a local
path you can do something like:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>SetLibPath&nbsp;/mymma/incs $_IncPath  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
to insert a local path into the path.

<P>
The current setting can be accessed via the macro $_IncPath.

<P>
Similar to I<SMALL>NCLUDE</SMALL>, but a bit more useful. The U<SMALL>SE</SMALL>
command is used to include library files and their predefined grooves.

<P>
Compared to I<SMALL>NCLUDE</SMALL>, U<SMALL>SE</SMALL> has important features:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The search for the file is done in the paths specified by the
  LibPath variable,

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The current state of the program is saved before the library
  file is read and restored when the operation is complete.

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Let's examine each feature in a bit more detail.

<P>
When a U<SMALL>SE</SMALL> directive is issued, e.g.:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>use stdlib/swing   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>

<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  first attempts to locate the file ``stdlib/swing'' in the
directories specified by L<SMALL>IB</SMALL>P<SMALL>ATH</SMALL> or the current directory. As
mentioned above, 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  automatically added the ``.mma'' extension to
the file and checks for the non-extension filename if that can't be
found.

<P>
If things aren't working out quite right, check to see if the filename
is correct. Problems you can encounter include:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Search order: you might be expecting the file in the current
  directory to be used, but the same filename exists in the
  L<SMALL>IB</SMALL>P<SMALL>ATH</SMALL>, in which case that file is used.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Not using extensions: Remember that files <SPAN  CLASS="textit">with</SPAN> the
  extension added are first checked.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Case: The filename is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">case sensitive</SPAN>. The files ``Swing''
  and ``swing'' are not the same. Since most things in 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  are case
  insensitive, this can be an easy mistake to make.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Quotes: <SPAN  CLASS="textit">DO NOT</SPAN> put quotation marks around the filename!

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
As mentioned above, the current state of the compiler is saved during
a U<SMALL>SE</SMALL>. 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  accomplishes this by issuing a slightly modified
D<SMALL>EF</SMALL>G<SMALL>ROOVE</SMALL> and G<SMALL>ROOVE</SMALL> command before and after the
reading of the file. Please note that I<SMALL>NCLUDE</SMALL> doesn't do this.
But, don't let this feature fool you--since the effects of defining
grooves are cumulative you <SPAN  CLASS="textit">really should</SPAN> have S<SMALL>EQ</SMALL>C<SMALL>LEAR</SMALL>
statements at the top of all your library files. If you don't you'll
end up with unwanted tracks in the grooves you are defining.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">In most cases you will not need to use the U<SMALL>SE</SMALL> directive
  in your music files.</SPAN> If you have properly installed 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  and keep
the database up-to-date by using the command:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>$ mma -g  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
grooves from library files will be automatically found and loaded.
Internally, the U<SMALL>SE</SMALL> directive is used, so existing states are
saved.

<P>
If you are developing new or alternate library files you will find the
U<SMALL>SE</SMALL> directive handy.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION0032100000000000000000"></A> <A NAME="MMAstart"></A>
<BR>
MmaStart
</H1> 

<P>
If you wish to process a certain file or files before your main input
file, set the M<SMALL>MA</SMALL>S<SMALL>TART</SMALL> filename in an RCFile. For example, you
might have a number of files in a directory which you wish to use
certain P<SMALL>AN</SMALL> settings. In that directory, you just need to have
a file <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">mmarc</SPAN></TT> which contains the following command:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>MmaStart setpan  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
The actual file <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">setpan</SPAN></TT> has the following directives:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Bass Pan 0 
<BR>
Bass1 Pan 0 
<BR>
Bass2 Pan 0 
<BR>
Walk Pan 0 
<BR>
Walk1 Pan 0 
<BR>
Walk2 Pan 0   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
So, before each file in that directory is processed, the P<SMALL>AN</SMALL>
for the bass and walking bass voices are set to the left channel.

<P>
If the file specified by a M<SMALL>MA</SMALL>S<SMALL>TART</SMALL> directive does not exist a
warning message will be printed (this is not an error).

<P>
Also useful is the ability to include a generic file with all the MIDI
files you create. For example, you might like to have a MIDI reset at
the start of your files--simple, just include the following in your
<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">mmarc</SPAN></TT> file:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>MMAstart reset  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
This includes the file <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">reset.mma</SPAN></TT> located in the ``includes''
directory (<A HREF="#incpath">IncludePath</A>).

<P>
Multiple MMA<SMALL>START</SMALL> directives are permitted. The files are
processed in the order declared. You can have multiple filenames on a
MMA<SMALL>START</SMALL> line.

<P>
One caution with MMA<SMALL>START</SMALL> files: the file is processed after
the RC file, just before the actual song file.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION0032110000000000000000"></A> <A NAME="sec-mmaend"></A>
<BR>
MmaEnd
</H1> 

<P>
Just the opposite of M<SMALL>MA</SMALL>S<SMALL>TART</SMALL>, this command specifies a file to
be included at the end of a main input file. See the comments above
for more details.

<P>
To continue this example, in your <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">mmarc</SPAN></TT> file you would have:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>MmaEnd nopan  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
and in the file <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">nopan</SPAN></TT> have:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>Bass Pan 64 
<BR>
Bass1 Pan 64 
<BR>
Bass2 Pan 64 
<BR>
Walk Pan 64 
<BR>
Walk1 Pan 64 
<BR>
Walk2 Pan 64   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
If the file specified by a M<SMALL>MA</SMALL>E<SMALL>ND</SMALL> directive does not exist a
warning message will be printed (this is not an error).

<P>
Multiple MMA<SMALL>END</SMALL> directives are permitted and processed in the
order declared. You can have multiple filenames on a MMA<SMALL>END</SMALL>
line.

RC Files
</H1>

<P>
When 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  starts it checks for initialization files. Only the first
found file is processed. The following locations/files are checked (in
order):

<P>

<OL>
<LI><TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">mmarc</SPAN></TT> -- this is a normal file in the current directory.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>~<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">/.mmarc</SPAN></TT> -- this is an ``invisible''
  file in the users home directory.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">/usr/local/etc/mmarc</SPAN></TT>

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">/etc/mmarc</SPAN></TT>

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf"> <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Only the first</SPAN></SPAN> found file will be processed. This
means you can override a ``global'' RC file with a user specific one.
If you just want to override some specific commands you might want to:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Create the file <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">mmarc</SPAN></TT> in a directory with 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  files,

<P>
</LI>
<LI>As the first line in that file have the command:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>include ~/.mmarc   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
to force the inclusion of your global stuff,

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Now, place your directory specific commands in your custom RC
  file.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
By default, no RC files are installed. If you have enabled debugging
(-d) a warning message will be displayed if no RC file is found.

<P>
An alternate method for using a different RC file is to specify the
name of the file on the command line by using the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">-i</SPAN> option
<A HREF="node2.html#i-option">(here)</A>. Using this option
you can have several RC files in a directory and compile your songs
differently depending on the RC file you specify.

<P>
The RC file is processed as a 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  input file. As such, it can
contain anything a normal input file can, including music commands.
However, you should limit the contents of RC files to things like:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>SetOutPath 
<BR>
SetLibPath 
<BR>
MMAStart 
<BR>
MMAEnd   </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
A useful setup is to have your source files in one directory and MIDI
files saved into a different directory. Having the file <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">mmarc</SPAN></TT>
in the directory with the source files permits setting O<SMALL>UT</SMALL>P<SMALL>ATH</SMALL>
to the MIDI path.

Library Files

Included in this distribution are a number of predefined patterns,
sequences and grooves. They are in different files in the ``lib''

<P>
The library files should be self-documenting. A list of standard file

<P>

<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  maintains a database file in each directory found in the

<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  starts up it sets a path list
containing the names of each directory found in <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">mma/lib</SPAN></TT>. When a
G<SMALL>ROOVE</SMALL> is needed 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  will look in the database files for
each directory. The directory <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">mma/lib/stdlib</SPAN></TT> will be checked

Maintaining and Using Libraries
</H2>

<P>
The basic 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  distribution comes with a set of pattern or style
files which are installed in the <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">mma/lib/stdlib</SPAN></TT> directory. Each
one of these files has a number of G<SMALL>ROOVE</SMALL>s defined in them. For
example, the file <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">mma/lib/stdlib/rhumba.mma</SPAN></TT> contains the
grooves <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Rhumba</SPAN>, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">RhumbaEnd</SPAN> and many more.

<P>
If you are writing G<SMALL>ROOVE</SMALL>s with the intention of adding them to
the standard library you should ensure that none of the names you
choose duplicate existing names already used in the same
directory.<A NAME="tex2html127"
  HREF="#foot19193"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">32</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN></SUP></A>
<P>
If you are creating a set of alternate grooves to duplicate the
existing library you might do the following:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Create a directory with your name or other short id in the
  <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">mma/lib/</SPAN></TT> hierarchy. For example, if your name is ``Bob van
  der Poel'' you might create the directory <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">mma/lib/bvdp</SPAN></TT>.
  <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Alternately</SPAN> you might create a new directory in your own user
  tree and add that name to L<SMALL>IB</SMALL>P<SMALL>ATH</SMALL> in your <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">mmarc</SPAN></TT> file
  (see above for details).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Place all your files (or modified files) in that directory.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Now, when your song wants to use a groove, you have two choices:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Include the file with the U<SMALL>SE</SMALL> directive. For example,
    if you have created the file <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">rock.mma</SPAN></TT> and want to use the
    <SMALL>GROOVE</SMALL> <SPAN  CLASS="textit">rock8</SPAN> you would:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>place the directive U<SMALL>SE BVDP/ROCK</SMALL> near the top of the
      song file. Note: it might not be apparent from the typeface
      here, but the filename here is all <SPAN  CLASS="textit">lowercase</SPAN>. In
      Unix/Linux case is important, so please make sure of the case of
      the filenames in commands like U<SMALL>SE</SMALL>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>enable the groove with the directive G<SMALL>ROOVE ROCK8</SMALL>
      (and here the case is not important since 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  thinks that
      upper and lower case are the same).

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Tell 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  about your new file(s) and G<SMALL>ROOVES</SMALL> by
    updating the 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  database with the -g or -G<A NAME="tex2html128"
  HREF="#foot19140"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">32</SPAN>.<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN></SUP></A> command line options. If you elect this route,
    remember that the order for the paths in L<SMALL>IB</SMALL>P<SMALL>ATH</SMALL> is
    important. If the filename or groove names duplicate material in
    the <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">stdlib</SPAN></TT> you may be better off forcing the include by
    doing a U<SMALL>SE</SMALL> ... a trick to set things up so that
    <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">stdlib</SPAN></TT> is NOT searched first is to use the
    S<SMALL>ET</SMALL>L<SMALL>IB</SMALL>P<SMALL>ATH</SMALL> command in a <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">mmarc</SPAN></TT> file to set your
    collection to the top of the list. See
    <A HREF="#libpath">here</A> for details.

<P>
Example: Assume you have created a new ``bossanova'' file. To
    force 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  to use this, a simple method is:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Create a user directory outside of the default 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT> 
      library tree. This is important! If you have both <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">stdlib</SPAN></TT>
      and <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">mystuff</SPAN></TT> directories in the default library path,
      <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">stdlib</SPAN></TT> will be searched first ... not what you want.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Let 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  know about your new collection by updating the
      <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">mmarc</SPAN></TT> file with an updated L<SMALL>IB</SMALL>P<SMALL>ATH</SMALL> (see above).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Update the 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  database with the command:

<P>

      <Table Hspace="40%" CellSpacing=0 CellPadding=10 BGColor="OldLace" Border=3>
        <tr><td>
    <B>mma -g  </B> 
   
	    </td></tr>
      </Table>

<P>
this needs to be done when you add new G<SMALL>ROOVE</SMALL> names to
      your file.

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
For those who ``really need to know'', here are the steps that 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT> 
takes when it encounters a G<SMALL>ROOVE</SMALL> command:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>if the named groove has been loaded/created already 
<FONT Face="Serif"  Color="Navy"><I>MMA</I></FONT>  just
  switches to the internal version of that groove.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>if the groove can't be found in memory, a search of the groove
  databases (created with the -g command line option) is done. If no
  database is in memory it is loaded from the directories pointed to
  by the L<SMALL>IB</SMALL>P<SMALL>ATH</SMALL> variables. These databases are then searched
  for the needed G<SMALL>ROOVE</SMALL>. The databases contain the filenames
  associated with each G<SMALL>ROOVE</SMALL> and that file is then read with
  the U<SMALL>SE</SMALL> code.

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
The databases are files <TT><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">.mmaDB</SPAN></TT> stored in each sub directory of
L<SMALL>IB</SMALL>P<SMALL>ATH</SMALL>. This is a ``hidden'' file (due to the leading ``.'' in
the filename). You cannot change the name of this file. Sub-directores
are processed in turn.

<P>
If a library file you create depends on G<SMALL>ROOVES</SMALL> from another
library file you will need to load that library file with a U<SMALL>SE</SMALL>
directive. This is due to limitation is the -g/-G update commands.

<P>
By using a U<SMALL>SE</SMALL> directive you force the loading of your set of
grooves.
