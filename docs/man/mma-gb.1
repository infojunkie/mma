.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B mma-gb


.SH DESCRIPTION

.B mma-gb
Browse the MMA groove library.

When the program starts up it will read all the existing
.B MMA
library files and create a small database file. You should be
.B root
or have write permissions for this ... if you don't the program will
continue, but it will need to read the database the next time.

Once loaded you will see several panels. The main panels on the left
side let you select a library file and the associated groove.
Just double click on a groove to play it. The
.B GUI
calls
.B MMA
for this with the
.B -V
option.

You can change the parameters used in the top 4 boxes.

The <help> option gives a brief overview.
.SH Caveats

The application is written in Tkinter, which should be available in most Python installations. It appears to be quite cross platform compatible and has been tested on Linux and Windows XP.
