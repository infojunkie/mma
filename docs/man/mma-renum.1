.SH NAME
mma-renum  \- renumber mma source files.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
.B mma-renum
.I INFILE

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B mma-renum
renumbers the bar line numbers in an existing mma song file.

When parsing the file any line starting with a digit is assumed
to be a chord-data line. Each line is numbered sequentially starting with "1".

Data lines which are processed (those with leading line numbers) are reformatted
with a basic spacing of chords.

.SH Caveats

A complete filename is needed for
.B mma-renum.
Unlike in
.B mma
the ".mma" extension is not automatically appended.

The existing file is deleted and a new file created. It is possible to lose data.

.SH SEE ALSO
mma(1), mma-libdoc(8).

.SH RESCOURCES
The latest version of this program is always distributed with
.B MMA
and is available at http://www.mellowood.ca/mma
