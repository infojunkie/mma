The files in this directory just illustrate various features
of MMA. Hopefully, they will help in creating some very cool
user donated library files.  They are presented only as
"proof-of-concept" examples.

For many more examples I suggest you browse the big archive of songs
supplied in the "mma-songs" tarball on the MMA site.

Unless someone can point to a definitive text showing that
publishing chords for a song is NOT a violation of copyright
we will only distribute mma songs in the main distribution which
are clearly public domain. This really does limit things!

However, a gzip file of many songs is available on the main
MMA website:

	http://www.mellowood.ca/mma/mma.html

PLEASE NOTE THAT THE SONGS IN THE ARCHIVE ARE DISTRIBUTED
FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.

The Python program 'mkall' will recurse though all the directories
and attempt to compile any '.mma' files it finds. The resulting
'.mid' file will be created in the same directory as the '.mma'
file.

Have fun!!!!!
