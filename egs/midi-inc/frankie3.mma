// Demo to show how to use MidiInc to create solo riffs.

// We import both our recorded tracks and:
//   rec1 is played by the tenor as a solo AND by alto as harmony
//   rec2 is played (with harmony) by a arpeggiating banjo

// Honestly, this is silly and SOUNDS AWFUL :)

Tempo 125   // again, a different tempo from the included file
