It's easy to import and convert existing MIDI files (or parts) into
 a solo/melody sequence!

There are 2 examples here:

 solo-seq.mma - this is really just a test to see if it all works. It modifies an
                existing groove to use the drums from the MIDI.

and

 melody-seq.mma - here we create a useable groove from sratch.

In both cases we're importing a drum track from a MIDI file "countme.mid" I
 found on the internet. You probably shouldn't redistribute that file or the
 drums generated. Remember, this is an example.

This should work well if you were to pound a drum track out on a set of MIDI
 drums or pad!

For a real groove you might want to use the PRINT option, write to a file, and use
 that info to set the sequences right in the lib file, avoiding the messy MidiInc
 (and the need to have a midi file to import from), as well as being able to tweak values.

This is all just example stuff. I know you can create much better!
