This directory contains various MMA files which
are intended to be included as ``boilerplate'' via
the MMAstart, MMAend and Include directives. The
directory should be part of the IncPath defined
in MMA in its initialization or via the SetIncPath
directive.


Standard pattern files are also located here. These files
define often used track patterns and are intended to be
included in groove files. It's a bit hard to decide what to
have in a standard file and in the groove, but we are
coming to the conclusion that most "on-the-beat" patterns
are "standard" and "off-beat" stuff belongs in groove files.
So, we'll put a definition for drum hits on beats 1 and 3
in the stdpats; but, drums on 1, 3 and the and-of-4 would
stay in the groove file.

We have stdpat files for:

	3/4   stdpats34
	4/4   stdpats
	5/4   stdpats54
	

Patch definition files go here as well. Please use descriptive names!
