This is a set of auto-accompaniment rhythms I've converted (stolen) from
my Casio WK-3000 keyboard. I've used a little conversion tool I wrote to do
this (shout if you'd like a copy, it's simple, short and not all that accurate).

The rhythms, with accomp, were played on the keyboard (1 finger chord mode)
and recorded using arecordmidi.

Each of the rhythms has been named with the Casio name. I've not bothered with
the built-in intro, variation and ending options that Casio gives ... mainly since
they sound pretty cheesy and they do a made-up melody which conflicts with my
handwritten ones.

I've added an introduction and ending to each file, as well as tweaking various 
settings. In most cases the endings are very simple 2 bar efforts with most stuff
ending on beat 1.

The instrument choices have been converted to GM MIDI from the Casio-specific ones
the keyboard uses.

MMA is able to recreate these accompaniments amazing well. No, they are not 100%. But
considering that the algorithms for timing, volume variations, chord voicing and just
about everything else are very different ... it's good enough for me.

I really do hope that you  add to or modify these files. But, if you do
improve them, please send them back so I can share with the rest of the community.

Enjoy.
