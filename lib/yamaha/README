These files were converted from Yamaha .sty files I found on the
internet and by other users and donated to for all to enjoy.
All files were marked as "free", so, hopefully, no copyrights
are being broken!

The files are documented with the other library files in the HTML docs
supplied with MMA. To use any of the files you need to do something like:

		 Use yamaha/some-file

at the top of your song. Then use the the various grooves like Main-A, etc.

Have fun!
