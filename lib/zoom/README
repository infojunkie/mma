The Zoom R24 recorder, like several other Zoom recorders, comes with a
collection of built-in percussion patterns. With a dedicated program
I've extracted these patterns from the R24 and turned them into MMA
grooves.

Each of the groove files contain one or more patterns that are usually
variants. For example, beat8 contains patterns 08beat01, 08beat02 and
so on.

Best is to play the patterns and select the grooves that fit your
song.

If you want to make your own rhythms, the Rhythm plugin may be helpful.
