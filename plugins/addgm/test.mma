// A first test for addgm plugin 

// This module will prepend the chord "Gm" to a line.
//   as is, it's outright stupid. But, there are times
//   when the ability to add constant things to a line
//   can be useful.

Plugin addgm     // load the plugin

// This tells use what plugins are loaded. It should
// just display "@ADDGM"

print Registered Plugins: $_DataPlugins

// In order to see what is created use the command "mma -r test"
