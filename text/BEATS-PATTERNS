A confusing part of the way MMA works are chord lines and patterns.

Let's start with a simple example. You have a pattern (it doesn't matter
if this is part of a complex groove or just a one line sequence). We'll 
set this up as a simple pattern for a chord:

  Chord   Sequence {1 4 90; 3 4 90;}

If you have been following the manual, you'll understand right away that we have
created a pattern which plays a chord at beats 1 and 3 (we are assuming 4 beats
per bar). 

If we have a data line:

  1  C

A "C" chord will be generated on beat 1 and 3. Simple and logical.

Now, what happens if we put different chords on the data line:

  1  C / Dm /

In this case, you'll get a "C" chord on beat 1 and "Dm" on beat 3. Again,
simple and logical.

The "problem" arises when we have chords not in sync with the pattern:

  1  C Dm E F

If you compile this and look at the output you will see that the "Dm" and "F"
chords are never played. Only a "C" and "E". Huh? 

It's not that complicated. MMA generates chords based on the pattern, not
the offsets in a chord data line. Again, chords are generated on beats
1 and 3 ... just like you directed. The chord settings on beats 2 and 4 will
only be used by patterns which generate a chord or note at the position. So,
any pattern which starts a note/chord on or after beat 2 and before beat 3
will use the "Dm", etc.

If this isn't completely clear ... read it again. And if not yet, write me.
