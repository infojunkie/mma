Changes file for the 2014 series

This reflects changes to MMA since the release of version 13.12.

================================


A considerable amount of work has been done is preparing MMA for Python 3.
 This work is not complete, and may entail more work. Hopefully it will
 be transparent to the user.

A minor error in the error reporting of DEFCHORD has been fixed.

An error in handling double sharps in the debug code in the ROMAN functions has been fixed.

MIIDWHEEL: values were being cut off at 1023 (0x3FF) instead of 16383 (0x3FFF). Opps :)
  Also worked on the docs for this to make it more clear.

  The original spec on using a bar count for offset used a 'B'. To end confusion over bar,
     measure   and beat the spec is now 'm'. So, to start the offset in 1 bar or measure use
     '1m'. This has also been added to specifying the duration. Use of 'b' was stupid.

MIDISPLIT: you can now use channel numbers (1,2,etc) or a track name 
 (Drum, Chord, Bass-Crummy). See the docs for more details.

HARMONY and HARMONYONLY can now accept "0", "-" or "None" to indicate no harmony
 for a sequence.

PRINTACTIVE: enhanced the output to include channel assignments and MIDI event counts.

MMASTART and MMAEND were not parsing file paths correctly. They now, as it says in
 the manual, search all the directories in the INCLUDEPATH. And they don't
 dump core anymore either.

I really, really think that midiInc now works properly. Number of fixes made, including
 the sending of program change messages properly, fixed the "measure" option for 
 start/end, and other minor things ... most caused by not recalculating when different
 tick settings between mma and imported file.

You can use the standard notation "3/4", etc. to specify a time sig.

When using +/- to adjust track volumes, all were set to the first (original) volume in
  the sequence. It now adjusts each seq point individually.

Added an ARTICULATE option to the Plectrum tracks. This makes the chords
  more staccato sounding. See the Plectrum docs in the manual.

Fixed bug which caused a crash with the SetMidiPlayer command.

Fixed bug in generating a strum line in the html docs.

Released 14.07 July 9, 2014.

========================================

Added Gliss and GlissAfter to Ornamentation options.

Modifed the calls to Ornament: It now correctly adjusts the offset so
 that all the notes in the chord/harmony sound at the same time; fixed the note
 selection from the chord so that we don't try to ornament a silent
 note (volume==0).

Fixed some error() calls in the ornamentation function.

Fixed crash if a empty macro was used.

Added RVOLUME option to Ornament.

Added a single '-' as an option to using '/' to indicate a repeated chord.

Added /* */ for multi-line or block comment.

New command CmdLine. This lets you set various command line options from
 inside a mma script. Some commands (-V, -G, etc) are not permitted. Handy
 for things like -T (set tracks) and -b/B (limit output). 

Fixed bugs in Midi(de)Cresc both in the track and global variants.

Thanks to gentle prodding from Ignazio Di Napoli a new feature, TIGGER,
 has been added. This lets you set conditions (beat, chord change,
 rest, etc) for a pattern to activate. Read all about it in the fine manual.

New command Sticky. This sets a track as "Sticky" which means that
 it is not restored (and overwritten) by groove commands.

Added "OFF" to trigger.

Added test to avoid warnings when using sequence lists in AllGrooves.

Added a trigger option: STICKY. This is a convience option and is
 identical to the standalone STICKY option, just handy to have it
 all in one place.

Added the 'StrumAdd' option. This simple option adds an additional value
 to the offset as the chord is processed. This lets you get more (or less)
 spacing between the notes as the chord is processed. 

Released 15.01 January 27, 2015.
