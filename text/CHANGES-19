Changes file for the 2019 series

This reflects changes to MMA since the release of version 19.07.

BUG: When running on windows a crash occurred since there is a not a fcntl
 module. This was used only when writing a buffer to a log file in *nix/mac.
 MMA now discards the option on Windows.
 
LYRICS are now permitted in repeat lines. If it is a "real" lyric, the
 text is ignored for repeated lines; if the CHORD option is enabled
 each line will contain correct chord info. Note: repeat lines are
 those set with the " * count" option.

The MIDI voice "DistortionGuitar" has been improperly spelled
 "DistoronGuitar" since very early versions of MMA (note the
 missing "i"). This is fixed, and the wrong spelling still works.

With the -d switch on LibPath caused an error. Fixed.

Leading zeros ('0') are now permitted and ignored in label line
 numbers. Permits line numbers like '001', '002', etc. to work with
 the -b option.

Added $_FilePath and $_SongPath variables. These, plus $_FileName will
 return '' (an empty string) if input is coming from STDIN.

Source lines terminated with LF/CR combinations have been converted to
 "unix" style (LF only). In the future, please submit ONLY files to
 the author in this format. MMA doesn't care, but 'patch' and other
 git programs do.
 
Minor documentation fixes and internal source comment clearifications/fixes.

August 4, 2019 - released version 19.08
========================================

RNDSEED - changed to require an integer argument (or none). Now produces
 same results in python2 and 3.

More documentation changes. I fear this comment will never stop giving
 me grief :)

Fixed debug error reporting.

Added extended groovename option. You can now specify as DIR:Groovename.
 As always, see the docs.

GrooveAlias had it arguments reversed in the code. Fixed to match the existing
 documentation, debug and error messages.

At some point in the development cycle the check for env. variables
 stopped working. It's fixed now.

Added the cmd line option -xNOCREDIT which will supress the insertion
 of "Created by MMA ... filename" text into the meta track. PLEASE DO
 NOT USE THIS.

Added cmd line option -xCHORDS=a,b,c. This will check each chord and see
 if it acceptable to MMA. Displays error lines and list of the valid chords.

Added cmd line option -xCHECKFILE=filename. This will parse (somewhat) the
 file listed and report any unknown chords. At this point a 'z' chord in the
 format CHORDxTrack will report an error.
 
Fixed circular import problem when setting debug options from cmd line.

October, 2019 - released version 19.08a
========================================

Fixed summary to show midi file duration as mm:ss.

Changed -g message to "Skipped" from "Existing" ... hopefully
 this is a bit more clear.

The options -xCheckFile and -xChords have been modified. They now
 take their args separately ... no '=' sign is needed/permitted.

The code for the zOPTIONS has been twiddled. You can now do something
 like 'zDC' to mute the drum and chord tracks and use the last chord.
 Hope this works ... it's ugly code! The docs for this section
 (Rests, section 8.4) have been rewritten,

October 26, 2019 - released version 19.08b
==========================================

Fixed bug in prettyPrint to handle errors.

Keysig accepts '0' as a synonym to '0b' or '0#'.

Volume, Decresc, etc have been revamped. They now recommend
  the use of an added '%' sign for increase/decrease to show
  clearly what is going on. Also, some dumb constructs like 'f + 10%'
  are now in error land.

The $( RandInt()) expression was not documented.
