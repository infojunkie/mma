Changes file for the 2021 series

This reflects changes to MMA since the release of version 21.09 (November/2021).

Fixed the docs for the COPY and COPYTO commands. There never was a COPYTO
 command! TO and FROM are extensions to the COPY command. Opps.

Added system variable $_PWD. This returns the current working directory just like
 the unix pwd command.

An empty argument for DRUM TONE resulted in a infinite loop. Fixed.

Added a bit of verbosity to the error message generated when defining a TONE
 or VOICE by a message if you have confused constants for the two.

Added a ERROR command. Text after the error is displayed and compilation stops.


Released 21.09.1 - August 29/2022
------------------------------

Changed the parser so that when setting the scale offset to use with bass
 patterns '-' and/or '+' can be placed before the digit(s) as well as after.
 For some people, I guess, it makes more sense to put the octave modifier first.

The options chord voicing options drop23 and drop23key had been commented out
 in 21.09 and 21.09.1. No idea why or how ... but they are back.

Released 12.09.2 - September 7/2022
------------------------------------

CHORDADJUST now accepts lower or upper case letters for the chord names.

The 'z' notation for chord muting has been enhanced. You can now use the notation
 "CHORDNAMEz+CBAWDSP" to specify which chords NOT to mute. To make things pretty
 you can use a leading '-' to indicate "mute these tracks".

Fixed crash when using an unknown option in RPitch.

Added BEAT option to RPitch. This lets you specify which beats to apply the rnd to.
