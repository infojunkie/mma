Just a short note about Fake Books (and I suppose other books or
sheet music) and the chords they show for songs... Quite often
the chords are wrong! Don't be misled into thinking that just
because it's published that way it's right. I've found the same
error in not only one book, but I've seen the same error duplicated
in different books by different publishers. In many cases you'll
see a song published in many different books all by the same
publisher, and the mistakes are faithfully copied in each volume.

So, if a chord in a song doesn't "sound right":

	- it might be a bug in MMA,
	- it might be your ears,
	- it might just be a dumb song,
	- it might be a typo on your part,
	- it might be a bad chart.

You will need a bit of musical education to track down some
problems, or a musician friend. But, if you see something like
a "Em" chord in the key of B-flat and it sounds "odd", you 
probably would be well to try a E-flat or E-flat-minor
chord instead.

Don't even ask how I know all this :)
