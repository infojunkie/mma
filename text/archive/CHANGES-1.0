A new track, ARIA, has been added. This lets mma create melodies (sort of).

Reorganized the solo extraction routine and harmony. This is now generating the
  correct velocities for the harmony notes.

Changed a number of chords and descriptions to match more standardized usage. Mostly in
  9ths and 11ths. Added some new chords and aliases. The descriptions are more detailed
  as to exceptions. Please refer to the document chords.pdf for details.

I've started to add things like:

     If Ndef ChordVoice
       Set ChordVoice Piano2
     Endif

  to style files. This makes it much easier to change the feel of a style from
  within a song file. See the softshoe lib file and the song L-O-V-E for a
  simple example.

To help in documenting the above, a new documentation command DOCVAR has been added.
  You should have a DOCVAR for each user variable you use in a library file.

It is sometimes useful to clear out current Groove definitions. So
  the command GrooveClear has been added.

Added NEWSET command. This is just like SET, but ONLY has an effect if the variable currently
  does NOT have a value. So:

      NEWSet Foo  something

    and

      If NDef Foo
	     Set Foo Something
      Endif

  are identical.

Added a SYNCRONIZATION command line flag. If you have a "-0" in the command line
  MMA will add a very brief on/off event at the start of each midi track it
  generates. You might find this helpful when lining up generated tracks in 
  multi-track editor.

Added a mini-how-to text file on TIMIDITY.

Added a split track program: util/timsplit.py.
