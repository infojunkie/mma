Fixed bug in MIDIPAN. Only first digit of argument was being used.

Added the -P command line option: plays the midi file and deletes it.

Added SETMIDIPLAYER. By default -P uses "aplaymidi" but you can change
  it.

MMA now attempts to track the length (time or duration) of the
  generated MIDI. Pretty accurate. Reported at end of run.

The error exit routine now checks the data reported as an error for
  illegal characters and reports.

Added a sanity check in input which converts any 0xa0 (non-breakable
  space) to 0x20 (space).

For folks using seq24 or other looping software another
  command line option (-1) has been added. This will force
  truncation of all tracks at the end of song position.

If you don't like too many command line args (which MMA is well on the
  way to getting), you can apply the -0 or -1 options via the
  SYNCRONIZE command (use Syncronize END and/or START).
 
This is way overdue! (De)Crescendos now do adjustments within the
bar(s). Makes for smoother changes.
