Added SWELL command. This is both a track and master command. It's the
  same as Cresc, but returns to initial volume. Technically called
  "messa di voce".

Fixed bug in seqrnd. If set in global with a seqsize less than the
  default a crash occurred.

The main module, mma.py, now contains a few lines of code to
  automatically enable pysco. Note: if you don't have pysco installed
  the load is ignored. Using pysco will speed up compilation to midi
  by about 33%.


Cresc, DeCresc and Swell future changes were not being deleted when
  loading a new groove. After a bit of head scratching the following
  has be set up:

  - since groove files normally do NOT have master volume settings, we
    permit (de)cresc to cross over groove changes.
  - groove files normally DO set individual volumes for each track. It
    is probably counter intuitive to let a previous (de)cresc effect
    an implicit volume setting in a groove definition. So, the future
    effect is discarded. A warning is displayed if this occurs.


Fixed bug in macro code so that hex values (and octal) are now
  recognized in comparisons. Previously code like "IF $something LE
  0x11" did not work properly. I think I also fixed some other instances
  where hex/oct notation wasn't picked up. Shout if you find more bugs
  here.

A new macro $_Track_Sequence has been added. This returns the patterns
  currently assigned to the specified track.

A new command line option -Dv has been added. This will display, on
  exit, the currently defined grooves, sequences and patterns. 

Extended voice/patch addressing as been added. MMA now supports
   controller 0/32 bank switching for additional voices. Please read the
   details in the Patch Management chapter.


Enhanced MidiPan: You can use 1 or 3 args. If you use 1, then a new
   Pan value is assumed and inserted; using 3 values assumes an initial
   value, new value and beat range. See the docs.

Some reorganization of the manual was done.

Multiple filenames were accepted on the command line, but only the
   first was processed. Only 1 permitted now!

February 14, 2008: Version 1.3 released.
