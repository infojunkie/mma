Fixed bug in lyrics chord name generation. When transposition was on
 the wrong chord names were sometimes being generated.

Fixed bug in -G command line code. Aliases we not being deleted
 between passes.

Released bug fix version 1.3.a March 8, 2008.

New command line option -T <track1,track2,etc>. This will permit the
 generation of MIDI data for ONLY the listed tracks. Useful in
 extracting data for multitrack stuff.

Added error trap for illegal PATCH options.

Added AllGrooves command. This makes it easy to change setting in
 multiple grooves. Documented in the GROOVES chapter of the manual.

Release 1.3b, April/2008 as devl trial.

Added begin/end to list of keywords for -Dk.

The auxiliary program mklibdoc.py has been renamed "mma-libdoc".
It is now installed in the same bin directory as MMA.

The auxiliary program mma-renum is now installed in the binary directory. A
man page for the program has been created.

Man pages have been created for mma, mma-renum and mma-libdoc. In the debian package
they are installed in /usr/share/man/man1; in standard distros they are
left in docs/man and installation is left as an exercise for the user.

A simple math parser has been added. You can use this anywhere a macro
is valid. Anything in $( )$ delimiters is evaluated (safely) using
Python. See details in the "variables" section of the manual.

Sanity check on tempo will no longer permit negative or zero values.

October 1, 2006 -- released version 1.4
