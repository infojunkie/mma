Changes file for the 2015 series

This reflects changes to MMA since the release of version 15.01.

================================

Added macro variables $_Track_Delay, $_Track_HarmonyOnly,
  $_Track_MidiVolume and $_Track_StrumAdd.

Fixed bugs in GRACE notes. When fixing the code which ensured that all
  the notes in a chord ended up with the same duration, we forgot that
  GRACE notes were supposed to be different. Well, they are now!

Harmony was NOT being applied to chords with grace notes. Fixed.

Solo note volume adjustments weren't working properly.

February 8, 2015
Released 15.01a

---------------------------------------------

Added RPITCH command. Modifies notes on-the-fly for random "mistakes".
 Actually makes some bass lines, etc sound quite natural. See the
 docs for details.

Added donated instrument file for Roland-mt32 in includes. Thanks 
 so much Hanno Behrens!

Added alternate spelling for TRANSPOSE and LYRICS TRANSPOSE. Both now accept
 interval syntax like "Up Minor Third", etc.

May 13, 2015
Released 15.01b

---------------------------------------------------


Added Subroutines. See the manual for details. This could be quite useful.


May 19, 2015
Released 15.01c

----------------------------------------------------

Fixed Transpose so that "Up Major 2" is the same as "Up Major Second".

Fixed the warning messages for slash chords so that things like C/B
 do not print warnings. The manual for slash chords has been
 (hopefully) clarified.

In the manual and code the COMPRESS option took values 0 (off), 1, ... 5.
 I have no idea why. The actual code only compresses once and the value
 is ignored. Docs and code are updated to reflect reality.

July 10, 2015
Released 15.01d

----------------------------------------------------------

Added Lyric option On or Off.

Fixed import error for python3.

Added fretnoise option in plectrum tracks. See the docs and a short
 example in egs/misc.

August 29, 2015
Released 15.01f

------------------------------------------------------------

Added -L option to report label/lines proceesed order.

CHANGED fretnoise strings are now numbered in the correct mode.
 String 1 is the highest sounding, just like a real guitar.

BUGFIX: fretnoise now looks for chord change instead of just string change.

September 9, 2015
Released  15.01g

Released 15-09

---------------------------------------------------------------


Modified -L option to show '?' for bars without labels.

Fixed MIDIINC which was crashing when importing a file with lyrics.

Fixed longstanding bug in the html docs which didn't show the MMA
 logo. A simple path issue. Thanks Anthony Fok.

Change to mma-gb so that that the database file is now stored 
 in ~/.cache (user's local directory). Thanks Anthony Fok.

Changes to mma-splitrec to make it work with python3. Thanks
 Anthony Fok.

The -G option now force deletes existing .mmaDB files. Should solve a
 problem with out-of-control recursion when a database is really
 screwed up.

Added $_TimeSig variable.

The TIME command has been expanded to include the option to set
  the time signature and a new concept of "Chord Tabs". This
  should make life easier if you use "odd" times and/or use
  notation editors to read MMA putput.

TIME now supports fractional settings. This makes it possible to do
  real compound times like 5/8 (Time 2.5), etc.

Note durations can be specified as tuplet ratios. An 8th note triplet
  could always be set as '3', you can now use '3:4'. No biggie, but
  you can also do stuff like '6:1' ( one sixth of a whole note).

Added new macro $_NoteLen(note). Returns the duration
  of the note in MIDI ticks.

October 10, 2015
Released 15-09a

------------------------------------------------------------

MidiPan: Added a 'm' option to the beat count. 

When grooves are restored (via a GROOVE command) a check is made
 for any unprocessed (DE)CRESC stacks. This means that you can
 force a gradual change over a Groove change ... this makes sense
 since a Groove will have it's own volume. However, SOLO and ARIA
 tracks don't get saved/restored with grooves ... so it doesn't
 make sense to NOT permit a solo/aria (de)cresc over a groove
 change. Done.

Added variable $_Ctabs.

Added "Add" option to transpose so we can change the current value.
 For the lyric option you need to append (or prepend) the "add"
 keyword to the transposition value.

A large number of library files were missing (the docs were there,
 but the porch light wasn't on). The entire library should now be there!

November 12, 2015
Released 15-09b

----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you create a database with Python3 and then attempt to read it with Python2
 an error is reported. Seems py3 has pickle protocols which py2 doesn't know.
 This is now trapped and the user is advised to run mma -G as root.

Fretnoise: Trapped bug to check for lack of a bass track being set; trapped 
 non-existent track error, fixed voice change in slave track

Cleaned up docs for ornament. Hopefully this is more readable now.

December 15, 2015
Release 15-12


------------------------------------------------------------------------

When setting a chord name you can have multiple '+'s or '-'s to
 change its octave.

String compares were mostly returning TRUE. Not what we want! I think this
 crept in when I added '<', '!=', etc. Fixed now.

Fixed timing issue with offsets in plectrum tracks. Thanks Iganzio!

Changed the error/warning routine to pretty print (wrap) messages.

Plugins. Please read the manual section and the additional PLUGIN API.
 Added macros $_Plugins and $_TrackName_Plugins.

Added chords 7b5(add13) and 7(add13).

The ChordAdjust code has been fixed up and has a RESET option. You
 can also concat a series of chords names: A,F,G=-1. Added a macro,
 $_ChordAdjust, to list current settings.

Version numbering: a minor change. We're still using YY.MM for
 the major releases. For minor (developer) releases we now
 use YY.MM.[a-z]. 

February 21, 2016
Release 15.2.a

-------------------------------------------------------------

DUPRIFF: Addition of the FROM keyword to reverse direction of copy.

Added the pluginUtils module for your plugins to access. Added
 Ignazio's documentation and updated his strumPattern plugin.

April 14, 2016

-------------------------------------------------------------


Added AFTER command

-------------------------------------------------------------

May 22, 2016
