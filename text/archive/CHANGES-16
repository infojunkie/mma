Changes file for the 2016 series

This reflects changes to MMA since the release of version 16.06.

Minor change to pluginUtils.py so that 16.06 is recognized. 

June 12, 2016: Reposted 16.06 packages. Silent fix.
---------------------------------------------------

There was an import error in regpluy.py which showed only when using python 3.x. Fixed

June 14, 2016: Reposted 16.06 packages. Silent fix (but posted message).
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fixed AFTER option parser. You can now have option pairs in the command to execute.

At some point I added a '5' option as a chord for so-called "power chords".
 This chordtype dropped the 3rd and duplicated in a 2nd 5th. Worked just fine.
 Then I added in '#5' as an alternate spelling for '+' or 'alt'. Now we have problems!
 I actually needed a '#5' (to accomodate a decending bass line) and used 'F#5'. Opps,
 it used a power-chord F# (and left the 5 alone). So, it's now changed ... for a
 explicit '#5' use the notation '(#5)'. Or, easier, just use 'alt' or '+'.

DefaultDrum now also works with Solo/Melody tracks when the drumtype option is
 set. Please read the cautions in the manual when you play with the
 "Tweaks DefaultDrum" option.

September 10, 2016: Released 11.06.a
------------------------------------

Added Min:Sec to report string (in addition to Min.ddd). Hope it's useful to someone.

Fixed bug in HTML doc generator. It was crashing with plectrum mute patterns.

The descriptions of a defined groove (for the docs) will always end in a '.'.

Fixed docs for the 'r' Direction setting in Aria. 'r*' was confusing.

Fixed error in the COPY command. Using extended groove/track notation was not working.

Enhanced the COPY command to support copying from to to a different track.

Added interval harmonies: Sxxx. See the fine manual.

Fixed bug in solo/melody tracks: the note middle C was never being
 harmonized (note: there really is a difference between the value 0 and None!)

Fixed bug in MidiInc which caused a crash when importing files using a START
 offset (stupid me didn't have enough ()s in my code).

Modifed the NOWARN flag in repeatend(ing) so that it can appear before or after the count.

Fixed truncate to properly do Side=value. Left/Right were working, the validity test
 for an int. arg. was wrong.

Changed the -L option report to display line ranges instead of every bar number. This
 makes it much easier to view the effects of REPEATs and other jump commands. A single
 '?' is still displayed for all unnumbered lines.

Moved a number of the debug options to their own file.

Moved the sync options to their own file.

Added a nowarn option to the AllGrooves command. This flag currently only effects the
 reporting of a global sequence change.

Added macros for time/date: $_DATEYEAR, $_DATEDATE, and $_DATETIME. You might want
 to use these if copyright strings.

The plugin registry has been modified so that you can have a plugin directory in
 your current directory. So, you can now have plugins/mycreation as well as mycreation.

Added the option to change the encoding used from cp1262 via an env varible MMA_ENCODING.

December 30, 2018 -- Released Version 16.06c  (last of the 16.06!!!!)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Revisited the parsing of the VOICING line. Added error traps.

Added new code to permit random setting in INVERT.

Fixed bug in lyric CHORDS=On which crashed if the TIME value had been changed.

Added environment variable MMA_ENCODING for global encoding value. By default
 it remains as cp1252.

The plectrum tracks have been treated to some enhancements, especially the
 addition of the SHAPE command. Thanks to Johan <jvromans@squirrel.nl>.

Added environment variable MMA_LOGFILE. If enabled this forces a logfile.

July 10, 2019 -- Released Version 19.07
