Short usage file for mmatabs.py.

This program is used to create the tables used in the MMA reference manual.
The program includes constant tables from the main MMA modules and creates
a series of latex files. Each file has a '.AUTO' extension.

Really only useful in maintaining the docs ... but you're welcome to it.
